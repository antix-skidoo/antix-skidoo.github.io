<div class="content">Edited by biker because it served no purpose. If offended. Blame my ignorant ass.<br>
<br>
The suggestion is offered to enable antiX to provide the best impression to a wide audience, which might possibly include users who are taking their first steps into Linux. It is sometimes difficult to recall how intimidating this is to novice users. If WIFI is not working for them they may simply discard antiX. In this case all the other reasons for using it will count for nothing.</div>

<div class="content">When I began my working life, I was taught the 5P rule:<br>
<br>
Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance!<br>
<br>
Hence, were I dependent upon a wifi connection, as well as downloading the antix bundle, I would download the required firmware from the Debian repo, and place it on a USB stick, just in case. <br>
<br>
Alternatively ethernet cables are very inexpensive, and provide a far more reliable connection when doing something major like installing an OS.<br>
<br>
And even now I am retired, I can still remember being taught the 5P rule and the times it has saved me from having to go running for help when the unexpected occurs. There's another rule about that too, called"Murphy's Law":<br>
<br>
If it can go wrong, it will go wrong.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with SamK but I think the problem may be related to the non-free nature of the firmware. We might not be allowed to distribute it on the LiveCD. That certainly seems to be what the license on the sourceforge page was saying. If it was included before then maybe that was a mistake (perhaps upstream) that has now been corrected. This is not my area of responsibility so I'm just guessing here.<br>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>BitJam wrote:</cite>...the problem may be related to the non-free nature of the firmware. We might not be allowed to distribute it on the LiveCD. That certainly seems to be what the license on the sourceforge page was saying.</div></blockquote>This is not my area of expertise, rather my thoughts after reading the licence and related Debian information.<br>
<br>
The package is being obtained from an official Debian repo. When doing so, there is no requirement to accept the terms of the licence agreement <strong>before</strong> downloading the software, e.g. via apt-get.<br>
<br>
The Debian package (firmware-ipw2x00_0.36+wheezy.1_all.deb), contains the standard Intel licence agreement referred to on the Sourceforge web page.<br>
<br>
The installation of the .deb triggers the display of the licence agreement <strong>before</strong> the package is installed to the file system. If this is declined the installation does not proceed. The user must agree to the licence in order that the installation proceeds. It is the standard Debian installation mechanism that ensures the licence is honoured. <br>
<br>
In this way firmware-ipw2x00_0.36+wheezy.1_all.deb (i.e. in an uninstalled state) may be shipped with the distro without infringing the licence.<br>
<br>
A simple script may be included in the installation ISO to manage the installation of the .deb to the file system and unload+reload the ipw driver. As this will use the standard apt/dpkg mechanism, the licence will be displayed and must be accepted in order for installation to be conducted.<br>
<br>
The outcome is:
<ul><li> The firmware is incorporated within the antiX installation ISO, and thereby any of its installed modes</li>
<li> Full compliance with the licence is achieved</li>
<li> antiX maintains its aim to be compatible with older systems</li>
<li> The user has a good experience with antiX"out-of-the-box"</li></ul>

<div class="content">Bug or No bug by technical deffinition. <br>
It is my hope that whatever a person feels is a problem / error / omission / hinderance in performace / bug / depretiative or hindering change / the OS falls short in any way it gets mentioned. As this is the ONLY way I can see that things be straitened out for the better. Even if there are more"issues" than can be dealt with, or"issues" that are not concerning, there will still be the knowledge that such a"issue" exists.

In that case my HP printer didn't work out of the box - I had to install HPLIP myself. I didn't realise things like that were classed as a bug; I just assumed some things a man has to do for himself. <br>

<div class="content">After booting, I think the next main priorities are X-windows and internet access. But as far as posts in this thread are concerned, almost anything goes IMO. I can guarantee you that not every bug or problem in this thread will get fixed. But we don't want people to self-censor themselves because then we are going to miss out on knowing what problems people are having.<br>
<br>
As far as the wireless issue SamK brought up. It was a <strong>regression</strong>! It worked in antiX-12 but then did not work in antiX-13. Of course that should be reported even if it turns out to have been intentional.<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Please don't discourage people from reporting bugs</li>
<li>The wireless issue SamK tracked down really needed to be reported</li>
<li>antiX is better and will further improve due to SamK's detailed, bug reports</li></ol>
SamK is not writing a review of antiX. He is trying to help by really digging in and finding things the devs might have overlooked. I realize these posts might be boring or even excruciating to onlookers but he is providing a very valuable service. He seems to be methodically testing almost every option and reports whatever seems to be broken. If anything, we need more SamKs, not fewer SamKs.</div>

<div class="content"><strong>Printer Setup Fails Due to Missing Group Membership</strong><br>
<br>
Setting up a printer in antiX-13.1-Stable via the Control Center produces the error message"<em>cups-authentication-canceled</em>" and setting up cannot be completed. <br>
<br>
The issue seems to be resolved by adding the user to the lpadmin group after which setting up completes OK.<br>
<br>
<strong>Suggestion</strong><br>
All antiX users are created as members of this group.</div>
