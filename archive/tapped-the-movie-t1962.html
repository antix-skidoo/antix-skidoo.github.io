<div class="content">A good filter usually is the best if we don't have access to pure water. But water is the basis to life and responds promptly to subtle impulses like thoughts, intentions and music.<br>

When time comes that even access to pure water becomes restricted, miracles may happen. That's why we should keep lucid and assume our task in life. Its a task like any other creature's, not grand nor small but unique.<br>
I was just remembering of the priest that fed people in besieged Sarajevo. He had not much food but the stock just never ended.</div>

<div class="content">My water comes directly from lake erie into a cistern. From the cistern it runs through a sediment filter which I converted from a water softener and then to a UV light. I have the water tested regularly and it's 100% potable(clean).<br>
<br>
Around here water can be expensive. If you live in or near town and have services you pay twice for water, first for what you use and then about 90% again for waste water. Outside of town you have two options: you can have it truck in and loaded into your cistern for about $65/2000 gallons or acquire a a container and load and haul yourself. When I can't pump from the lake I use two 250 gallon"totes" and make trips to the depot as needed. I normally only have to do this in the winter when the lake is frozen or the water is too rough/wavy to pump from because of silt.<br>
<br>
I don't like using the town water if I can help it because it's heavily chlorinated and you can really smell it. The chlorine also tends to kill any bacteria in the cistern and can foul the water making it smell. The filter and light is unable to remove the already dead bacteria so another filter is needed(charcoal) to remove the smell.<br>
<br>
It can be a little work to get water but knowing this tends to make you conserve a little more. I also have to consider my waste water. It is collected in a septic tank to breakdown and then filtered through a septic bed but the tank still requires emptying every few years.<br>
<br>
Being aware of what's happening makes you think about your water usage. When you work for your water your forced to conserve and take nothing for granted. If I laps on my monitoring I will run out and I don't want that to happen.</div>

<div class="content">My small ranch in Esperanza Tx in the Rio Grande Valley has a well which is 15 feet to water. But it is Salty. Takes a Reverse Osmosis system to make it drinkable. I also have a water meter there (believe it or not) that has water pumped from 20 miles away from a private company in Ft Hancock Tx which costs 60 a month for 2000 gallons or less. Even if shut off it is 60 a month to keep meter. They are not installing any new meters out where my ranch is. So any body moving there has to truck it in or dig a well.<br>
<br>
Here in Pecos since it has City Water. We are on that. It is hard to drink unless you grew up here and wouldn't notice. I run a Water Pic Faucet Filter to get around that. At my ranch I run a under the sink Reverse Osmosis $199.00 filtration Charcoal in series with a Gravel Tank and Screw in filters in series that works excellant whether on meter or well. Well is hard on Swamp Cooler there (Calcium buildup). Hence using the meter (Small improvement but still builds up calcium deposits)<br>
<br>
Living in a Desert Environment makes me frugal and think ahead any ways when it comes to water. I have trucked it in and washed clothes and flushed toilets with a 5 gallon bucket with Water trucked in by me in 50 gallon plastic barrells (river is 500 yards away) And have used irrigation water as Brown water also for certain applications. All this 20 years ago when first getting my small ranch together. You have to be inventive and work hard for the basics out here. So the video is nothing new for me. My ranch is set up to go off the grid if the world comes to that. Would love to afford a Areo Motor Windmill.

And hook it up with a Above Ground Gravity fed Cistern Tower also. Its always something that needs doing.
