I change it a little with the antix name because I still could not find the original but I was able to find the one with no names on it. Here are the 2 fix for you.<br>

Thank you so much, I really do appreciate your finding this, I did not realize it would be this problematic for you, your work is so unique and I knew I could not duplicate or replace this particular wallpaper without your help. Bless you and please continue your outstanding work that we all are very appreciative of. You are very talented and we are the fortunate recipients to have such a vast repository of wallpapers to choose from.<br>

oldhoghead</div></blockquote>Thanks to you for your kind words and always so supportive to my cause. Really what did happen a while a go my site went completely down so I could not get back the same images or wallpapers. I had to look disk by disk. I could not find it between so many images that were done and others that were not. I learn a lesson this time thanks to what did happened to me and also when you came and ask for the image. INow it iwll not happen again that i have to look for certain image anymore or for a group of images. We change when we get in trouble so it was the cse this timme and I really appreciate it that you brought your image to my attention for me to get it. I became better in saving things around. Thanks a lot for your noble intention you made something to be great and correct without you even knowing about it. You did good for someone like me.<br>
<br>
Thanks champion!<br>

Thank you for the kind words, it is a fact that we pay for our education, whether with money or other means, I learned a good lesson too, not to assume that I had a current backup as I did not! So we both learned a valuable lesson, backup,backup and have another backup.<br>
Thanks again for the work involved to provide this for me, I know that there are other users who will appreciate this one too.<br>

oldhoghead</div></blockquote>Thanks champ. This is what i did. You know I had these in dvd's I am not kidding, around 2000 and each of these have different stuff on it. As you know dvd's will get scratch with time even if you take care of it 95 % at least. Having so much fdifferent information books, etc... and is very hard to write anywhere what you have on each dvd's. I went to the store and got an outside usb harddrive Iomega radioshack 1T. It works like the wind, smoooooth. Now I have to take the time to make folders and copy and copy into it. The dvd's will go to a safe none touch place, for keeping it for additional backup. Well my friend thanks again for the response and let's continue kicking in this cyber world. <br>
<br>
