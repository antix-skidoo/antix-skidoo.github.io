<div class="content">Grub-2 to Grub-0.97. Pkg in Synaptics for that?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, Any...<br>
<br>
<br>
PRELIMINARY<br>
I use Grub 0.97 for handling all my multi-boot needs. I use it because it is simple, boots all O/S's on my system, and it's simple. <br>
<br>
A couple of days back I loaded another distro (for trial only, Antix is going great) but pressed the wrong option near the end of install - and installed Grub-2. It wasn't such a careless accident; it was one of those <em>if-it-goes-either-way-I'll-fix-it-later"</em> moments, derived from a confusing prompt during install. I am reasonably sure I can use a disk-based-tools pack to re-install Grub 0.97 without trauma (from previous experience).<br>
<br>
However, today I noticed in the Synaptic Pkg Mgr on Antix that there is a downloadable package <strong><em>grub-gfxboot</em></strong>, version <strong>0.97</strong>. To me, that looks like it could be the"Grub" I use.<br>
<br>
QUESTION-1<br>
If that is so, can anyone tell me how that install of <em>grub-gfxboot</em> is used? Do I download the package whereupon a GUI is provided (in menus) for that? Does it provide a Command Line program? Just how is it installed and used? [This is a critical operation, so precise info would be appreciated.]<br>
<br>
.<br>
SIDE-ISSUE OF RELEVANCE<br>
<br>
QUESTION-2<br>
Further, I notice that <em>above</em> that download in Synaptic is <em>grub-customizer</em> for Grub-2. On my system, although loaded, it does not show up in any menu. [So I located it in the filesystem (/usr/bin) and ran it, but I'm curious why it is downloaded but isn't in the menus?]<br>
<br>
.<br>
SIDE-ISSUE OF RELEVANCE<br>
<br>
QUESTION-3<br>
Furthermore, now that I have learned how to use <em>xorg.conf</em> to get my graphics driver (and other components) working in Antix, and now also seen the config setup inside Grub-2, it seems to me that Grub-2 is almost a merge of <em>Grub-0.97</em> plus <em>xorg.conf</em>. (Perhaps not a precise"merge", but it does almost the same job as the two together?) Is that about right?<br>
<br>
<br>
WRAP<br>
For me, these issues are tied together because, without any driving need to keep the Grub-2 setup, I still want to downgrade it to Grub-0.97 because that is simple and easy to use. <br>
<br>
These matters all tie together <strong>IF</strong> I am able to use the Antix <em>grub-gfxboot</em> package for that purpose. <br>
<br>
So, can you advise?<br>
<br>
Regards,</div>

yes, grub-gfxboot will bring grub-legacy .97 in. No, there is no menu entry for it. Grub2 will be removed. grub-customizer I do not believe will work with grub-legacy.<br>

good question. it should be in the Preferences Folder (that's where it shows up on mine).<br>

nope. grub customizer works with grub. xorg.conf goes with the X server. Grub2 allows for a lot of things that grub-legacy can't handle, not the least of which is UEFI boot support, if at the cost of some"ease of use".<br>

After you install grub-gfxboot, you will need to run
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo update-grub</code></pre></div>
to generate the grub menu.lst file with the Operating System entries<br>
<br>
and <br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo grub-install /dev/sdX  </code></pre></div>
where sdx is the device name where you want grub installed to the mbr. For instance, on my system it would be <br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo grub-install /dev/sda</code></pre></div></div>

you know what's funny. I just install grub-gfxboot in a vm to try, and it worked straight away. grub-legacy still shows uninstalled. Did you guys do a wrappup package at some point with everything in it?</div>

<div class="content">You know, dolphin_oracle and anticapitalista, here's something else that's funny. [Remember, I'm a Pnewbie (ie Post-Newbie; silent"n"; copyright waived) so not <em>many</em> things in Linux are"funny" yet - they are still pretty stressful.] <br>
<br>
<br>
Given dolphin_oracle's note about the funny thing with his"grub_gfxboot" download/install, I also note another funny thing - a couple actually...<br>
<br>
<br>
1.<br>
The first funny thing is, despite dolphin_oracle's first post comment about having a"Preferences" folder (I assume you mean in the Menu folders)"Preferences" is not showing on my Antix. [So I guess I'll have to modify that in MenuLibre or something at that level? Yes?]<br>
<br>
<br>
2.<br>
The second funny thing directly relates to dolphin_oracle's note about"grub-gfxboot". I wanted to do as anticapitalista said, and download the"grub-legacy" pkg. However, at the website (ie the link recommended) it said (roughly) <em>"preferred to load via a pkg manager"</em>. So I went looking for it in Synaptic and found it -"grub-legacy". (I did NOT select"grub-gfxboot", just"grub-legacy".) Synaptic installed it, and also automatically removed a PART of Grub-2. <br>
<br>
From that point I became confused between dolphin_oracle and anticapitalista - and the next step. [Not a complaint - just noting I was confused.] So I went looking on the Internet for backup info, but became more and more confused. As I dug deeper and deeper (to ensure I got it right) I finally stopped digging (my grave) when I ended up at <em>"chrooting"</em> and <em>"chroot jails"</em> (and some massive argument Developers were having about THAT!). Duh? What's <em>THAT</em> all about!!<br>
<br>
So, I took a step back, and re-typed <em>one more</em> search, specifically for grub 0.97 install and ended up here...<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://pclosmag.com/html/issues/201101/page10.html"<br>linktext was:"http://pclosmag.com/html/issues/201101/page10.html"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Since I had installed and used PCLinuxOS 2014 (ie 32-bit) recently and found it to be bloody good - until I learned that 32-bit WITH my olde graphics card (you might know about that from this forum) aren't supported. (Still a very nice distro system though!)<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to Antix and Grub 0.97. and the"counter" funny part to dolphin_oracle's funny part...<br>
<br>
After the install by Synaptic, and as per recommendation in the above link, at a terminal I typed-in"grub". Sure enough at the prompt I find that <strong>Grub 0.97</strong> is now installed on my Antix setup. As far as I can see, now I just follow-through on commands recommended by anticapitalista, dolph_lungren, and pclosmag - and I should have working Grub0.97 again.<br>
<br>
(Unfortunately, just this second, I opened Grub-Customizer again, thinking it MIGHT NOW be for Grub-0.97, but it is still for G-2 (although a <em>completely different</em> GUI to the last time), so I immediately shut it down. Hope that doesn't cause a problem in the next step!)<br>
<br>
.<br>
So, to me, since my old"menu.lst" file is still intact, and since Grub-0.97 is installed (ready and waiting), and since Grub-2 has overrun the MBR, the next procedure is just to get the 0.97 MBR back. So setup should be as simple as...<br>
<br>
grub<br>
root (hd0,0)<br>
setup (hd0)<br>
quit<br>
<br>
...which should re-install 0.97 into the MBR, and point it to 0,0<br>
<br>
Right?<br>
<br>
So, if you don't hear back from me in the next few minutes you'll know that I am reloading distros and W2K (and cussing all the way!).<br>
<br>
Anyway, here goes. Geronimo!!!!.....</div>

So, simply download the"grub-legacy" pkg using Synaptics (which also auto-removes Grub-2 components) then follow commands as in my previous post.<br>

<div class="content">Hello, dolphin_oracle...<br>
<br>
Thanks for responding.<br>
<br>
OK. Our menus are different. I have attached a cropped image showing my main menu (at top-level as"Applications Menu"), with the Settings sub-section (which appears to be a close approximation of the menu slivver you demo'd). <br>
<br>
On the basis of that I am satisfied that I may not be missing menu items - just that they are arranged differently. Why <em>that</em> is I do not know. I have not adjusted any menus - either with program or manually. (I have only used Synaptic to download packages - which I assume were"configured" appropriately into menus.)<br>

<div class="content">No, dolph..., there is no"Preferences" folder/sub-folder anywhere. <br>
<br>
There's no"Grub" anything in <em>any</em> menu either. (Nor would I expect that I suppose - unless there was a GUI to manage it.)<br>
<br>
I did take a screenshot under"System" menu to show you but that is probably pointless; neither exists in any form, anywhere. If there is <em>definitely</em> supposed to be something then let me know (and I might start another thread for that). <br>
<br>
The menu thing is now a side-issue in this topic. I'm happy that Grub-0.97 can be re-done so easily. <br>
<br>
[In case any other LinUsers track this thread down (ie to change Grub-2 back to Grub-0.97 for some likewise"wierdy" reason) I'll add my final comment to caution that, in my prep-reading for this attempt I noticed discussion that Grub-0.97 may not work with disks over 2-TB, but I didn't absolutely confirm that. (For me,"non-issue".)]<br>
<br>
<strong>All things being equal, Grub-0.97 re-install issue - <em>solved!</em></strong> <br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks, Each.<br>
