<div class="content">Most of the debt in the world cannot and will not ever be repaid.<br>
<br>
The only difference between Greece refusing to repay it or not refusing to repay it is that it is a lot more obvious that the money lent will never come back.<br>
<br>
Which also begs the question, why would or should anyone lend them more money?<br>
<br>
And also the question, Why do they need to borrow more?<br>
<br>
IMO, people and nations should live within their means of production and be debt free, and should save to buy what they want, and work to buy what they need. Of course with confetti money, what difference does it make, just click the mouse and print more trillions of whatever currency you like seems to be the way of the world these days.<br>
<br>
And so it came to pass, that the Central Banks, and Governments were the very WORST of the counterfeiters. And as a result, their printed and digitally cloned currencies will need to be rendered worthless by further counterfeiting so the debts can be pretended to be repaid.<br>
<br>
That's just my 2 cent opinion...</div>

Exactly. But not to worry, the central bankers have it figured out, and the answer is to click the mouse again and create some more so it will be there. This same game has been played many times since the inception of"currencies", and the end result is always that the paper is worth as much as paper, whether it be to wipe your butt with, print on it, or as fuel to burn.<br>
<br>
I think the best answer is for Greece to drop out of the Eurozone and go back to being their own country with their own money, or perhaps just let people use whatever money they like? The banks could just build in currency exchange mechanisms to convert to whatever currency they give out at ATM's or withdrawls, and each account or loan could be made in whatever currency the person wanted. That at least avoids the problem of creating a Greek currency that quickly becomes worthless. <br>
<br>
LOL, obviously I haven't thought this out well, but I suspect neither have they.<br>
<br>
IMO, we are in a worldwide depression where the central banks are printing to keep money in everyone's pockets, and not worrying about the long term consequences of when anyone wants the loans repaid other than to just print more, then, too.</div>

</strong>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>So now that Mr. Tsipras has won, and won big, European officials would be well advised to skip the lectures calling on him to act responsibly and to go along with their program. The fact is they have no credibility; the program they imposed on Greece never made sense. It had no chance of working.<br>
<br>
If anything, the problem with Syriza’s plans may be that they’re not radical enough. Debt relief and an easing of austerity would reduce the economic pain, but it’s doubtful whether they are sufficient to produce a strong recovery. On the other hand, it’s not clear what more any Greek government can do unless it’s prepared to abandon the euro, and the Greek public isn’t ready for that.<br>
<br>
Still, in calling for a major change, Mr. Tsipras is being far more realistic than officials who want the beatings to continue until morale improves. The rest of Europe should give him a chance to end his country’s nightmare.</div></blockquote>
Note that"Syriza" stands for"Coalition of the Radical Left" in Greek. It is slightly humorous that Krugman says their plans may not be radical enough. It is interesting that they formed a government with a small right-wing anti-austerity party called ANEL. Syriza nearly won an outright majority with their 149 seats but they needed to form a coalition to get at least 2 more seats. ANEL has 13 seats. <br>
<br>
I think Krugman is right. The austerity program was delusional from the start. It was a totally predictable and massive failure. Yet another shining example of the total disconnect between neoliberal economics and reality. The austerity program was the equivalent of shooting someone in the leg to get them to run faster. Then shooting them in the other leg. And then blaming all of their problems on a lack of moral fortitude. <br>
<br>
In addition to the worry of Syriza not acting radically enough, I am also concerned because a bunch of powerful yet delusional people have just run face-first into a wall of reality. People generally hate to be awoken from their delusions. Will the people who have caused this Greek tragedy act like abusive parents and try to further ratchet up their abuse? Will a few bad apples try to sabotage the Greek recovery in order to"prove" they were right all along?<br>

I don't think it matters how its done, but in any event, Greece is in for a lot of financial pain, and these extend and pretend programs just are kicking the can a few more months, extending the pain FOREVER, rather than just saying to hell with Euro's and the Eurozone and the IMF, and just starting fresh. NOTHING is going to make those bonds financially sound other than just printing the money to pay them off, because the money to pay them off doesn't exist, and never will.</div>

And by doing O.K., Greece has done the rest of Europe a favor.<br>
<br>
[...] So did the current Greek government back down and agree to aim for those economy-busting surpluses? No, it didn’t. In fact, Greece won new flexibility for this year, and the language about future surpluses was obscure. It could mean anything or nothing.<br>
<br>
[...] Meanwhile, the first real debtor revolt against austerity is off to a decent start, even if nobody believes it. What’s the Greek for “Keep calm and carry on”?</div></blockquote></div>

<div class="content">Have to disagree with you there BJ.<br>
<br>
It was a surrender. The deal has nothing positive at all for the people of Greece. <br>
<br>
Now, maybe. the only positive is that the whole world has seen what the IMF, EU, ECB (bank) is all about. If anyone even dares to challenge the economic orthodoxy or proposes that there is an alternative to TINA, we see how the Euro capitalist class (regardless of their national origins) responds. Threats and blackmail.<br>
<br>
However, all is not lost. The real power to stop the Troika and implement an alternataive lies with the workers and masses themselves, not the (however well-meaning) politicians. SYRIZA has always been pro-EU and hopes to change things within the existing system. It never works. What is needed is a complete break from the system.<br>
<br>
Cancel the debt<br>
Leave the EU<br>
Nationalise the banks under workers control <br>
Fight for workers power/revolutionary socialism where the workers themselves organise society on the basis of need not profit.</div>
