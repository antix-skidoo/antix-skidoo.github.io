<div class="content">First and foremost, the job OU812 did on the default IceWM if outstanding! I never thought I would like IceWM but there is not a shadow of a doubt that antiX IceWM is the best OOTB there is. Congrats!<br>
<br>
One thing I noticed though is when switching back to a customized Fluxbox (not default wallpaper, and with wbar running) it doesn't set the wallpaper back to what you had it set to. Also, wbar seems to restart and have two instances of wbar running one on top of the other and the background behind wbar does not change. Even though I am in Fluxbox, the wallpaper behind wbar is that of IceWM. Minor things but just wanted to let you know! Great job anti and group!<br>
<br>
Edit: Also, I just started playing around with the Control Center and it is amazing. Everything I have tried so far works and is very simple. This will be appealing to a lot of new Linux users who need a little more graphical intervention. Great job once again!</div>

For switching from ice to fb, I thought we had that fixed. There's a post in the forums with a fix (probably in announcements). That's all I can tell you now - my laptop was stolen from my house with all of my antix stuff on it. So, it will be awhile before I can get back to normal (in so many ways).<br>
<br>
For wbar, hmm. In your case, you may want to write a script that kills wbar and then goes into fb (when you want to switch from ice to fb). This script would replace the entry in the menu where you would simply go into fb. This is just a quick guess.<br>

<div class="content">OU812, sorry to hear about your laptop getting stolen.<br>
<br>
The switching from icewm to fluxbox and setting wallpaper, is definitely fixed for the final iso. I think it may not be fixed when upgrading from antiX-M7.2 (or earlier) to antiX-M7.5 via the antiX-upgrader script.<br>
<br>
I suppose Jaws could try what OU812 sent me, in a pm:<br>
<br>
Sorry to hear about the wallpaper. Let's it try again, from the top. Please do these steps in order:<br>
<br>
1. Make sure in ~/.xinitrc you have<br>
Code:<br>
exec icewm-session<br>
<br>
2. Make sure ~/.icewm/startup is executable.<br>
3. You should have only two files in ~/.config/nitrogen/ they are:<br>
bg-saved-icewm.cfg and bg-saved-fb.cfg<br>
They should just be copies of bg-saved.cfg. (New step) In fact, edit them by hand so they each name a different wallpaper.<br>
4. Again, make sure you delete bg-saved.cfg and have only the two files from 3.<br>
5. New step to try:<br>
Open a terminal. Enter (assuming you are using fluxbox):<br>
Code:<br>
ln -s ~/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved-fb.cfg bg-saved.cfg<br>
<br>
Then do<br>
Code:<br>
cd ~/.config/nitrogen/<br>
ls -l<br>
<br>
You should see something like<br>
Code:<br>
lrwxrwxrwx 1 john users 46 2008-07-13 15:27 bg-saved.cfg -&gt; /home/john/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved-fb.cfg<br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 john users 71 2008-07-10 16:44 bg-saved-fb.cfg<br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 john users 75 2008-07-12 18:29 bg-saved-icewm.cfg<br>
<br>
6. Modify the two startup files by adding these lines, in order:<br>
Code:<br>
rm $HOME/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg<br>
ln -s $HOME/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved-icewm.cfg $HOME/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg<br>
nitrogen --restore &amp;<br>
<br>
<br>
Code:<br>
rm $HOME/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg<br>
ln -s $HOME/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved-fb.cfg $HOME/.config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg<br>
nitrogen --restore &amp;<br>
<br>
7. Log out/in to each wm, starting with fluxbox. They should each display the wallpaper you chose in step 3.<br>
8. If you want, now try using nitrogen to set a new wallpaper for each wm. And then log out/in to each wm again.<br>
<br>
I really can't think of anything else I did differently. Hope this finally works. (Step 5 I think will make a difference. And editing the .cfg files in step 3 gives you a good idea as to whether or not things are heading in the right direction.)</div>

<div class="content">Anti and Team,<br>
<br>
I am blown away on how clean antiX 7.5 is OOTB and I was hesitant about looking at IceWM but was I booted and switched over to it <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
I just finished installing it now and had a few questions about setting up the way I want it:<br>
<br>
1. Can I install KDE alongside with IceWM so that I may switch between them? I want to see if I can get KDE setup the way I had it on SM 6.5 with 3D and have familiarity for my wife.<br>
<br>
2. Can I remove fluxbox and have just KDE and IceWM? <br>
<br>
3. How can I set the default window manager to login to another environment (e.g., IceWM)?<br>
<br>
More to come, I'm working on getting my wireless to work now<br>

<div class="content">1. Yes, you can. At login screnn, toggle F1 and you will see some pre-set options.<br>
<br>
2. Yes you can. Though simply not using it won't make any difference. Fluxbox only takes up about 2MB (if that)<br>
<br>
3. You need to edit the .xinitrc file in your home folder.<br>
Change this line (the last one) from fluxbox, to the one of your choice.<br>

THANK YOU, SIR! After I posted this I realized that I was unsure of the best way to install KDE, so I figured I'd ask on ML forums as people have done it there already.<br>
<br>
I'll keep fluxbox then, I didn't realize how small it was... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
