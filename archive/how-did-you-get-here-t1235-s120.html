<div class="content">Hi everyone.<br>
I started using Antix M11 2 days ago, and got here not an easy way. I've used about 30 different Linux (and BSD) distros from 2007 till now (although never used MEPIS or"pure" Debian, just plenty of its derivatives - Knoppix, DSL, Ubuntu, TAILS and so on), so now I suppose to have a clue. On this very HP nc2400 laptop I'm typing from, there was Sabayon (XFCE edition). I thought it would be rather fast but it disappointed me with its speed (boot time and overall programs launch and installation time). I've tried TAILS before (Debian-based distro focused on security, as this is my primary speciality) but it wasn't meant to install on HD and had no useful tools to complete the installation and updates. Having no time for this, I gave it up. Then I just googled this very phrase:"fast linux" and came across an old Antix review, then your official website. I thought it would be a damn good substitute for Sabayon, as it really turned out to be. Yes, I had to do some more initial configuration than expected, but it took about 10 minutes total and had to be done only once. No more launch lags on my laptop. Nice Fluxbox desktop with customized menu and Thunar out of the box. And the good ol' Synaptic, of course.<br>
<br>
P.S. On another machine, I still run Arch Linux but look for its substitute too. I think it will be the same. I like minimalist distros but most of them are pendrive- or liveCD-oriented (my favorite are SliTaz and Porteus) and hardly suitable for desktop use. Antix brings just what lots of people usually expect of Linux to the regular desktop: time-tested platform (Debian), great usability and minimal resources overhead.</div>

<div class="content">well I guess I should do this heh<br>
<br>
I am a bit of a nut about putting linux on old crap, its a past time ... I have a powermac 9600 with debian, a 8 meg pentium 90 with deli, a 4 meg 386 with old debian on it, anyway my dad was going to dump his old laptop, and its a nice laptop and I like old computers so I snagged it, nice little Fujitsu, less than 3lbs and a inch thick great 800x600 TFT lcd, cardbus and best of all it had 80 megs of ram in it.<br>
<br>
I was running connochaetos on it, and its ok I guess ... about the same type of setup as anti, but its arch based and I prefer debian, I dont really like pacman, mouse didnt work at first sound never worked, pcmcia / cardbus didnt work, less software on the disc and hardly anything in repositories (gee I could think of a million things better to do than compile software from source on a pentium MMX) <br>
<br>
so looking around I found this, which fixed almost all my problems with just a simple install (sound still doesnt work but I have not messed with it yet) and now antiX is also running on my"craptop" a 2.4 ghz celeron just fine and dandy<br>
<br>
thanks guys, you did an excellent job</div>

I have not been here in some time. I had to re-register as I could not remember my old user name or password. It's good to be back. I see everything works as well as I remember. Thanks anti.<br>

Hi rosalux, and welcome to the antiX forum! Sounds like your friends were unable to keep you away from computers forever, thanks to your sister! The antiX distro is just perfect for the old relics! I've been running some kind of antiX on all of my systems since 2006, and I happen to have three distinct images installed on my systems right now.<br>
<br>
Great forum here. Hope you like antiX and hope to see you around. We have other guys around here with great name handles - with stuff like"rust" in the name, Dark-D, anticapitalista, then, there are some ordinary names like mine (though it's not a very common name, except for those from the Ukraine, which is where the family name originally came from. I'm one of those"USA guys" though; there are a few of us in the forums.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your systems, and I hope you also enjoy the forum enough to stop in and say"Hi" every now and then. If you have questions, this forum is the right place to come. Glad to have you with us!</div>

Yeah, but you are fairly new to these forums, too - say within the past release or so. Our new friend, rosalux, is just joining the forum. In comparison, you're now a 'veteran', and you've already shared quite a few valuable things since you've been with us. Looking forward to seeing more new forum friends as we come out with M12.0 soon.</div>

<div class="content">I think I have forgot to do what this thread is about...<br>
<br>
I bought my little acer netbook when they were released here in Norway.<br>
It came with the linpus lite os, which was my first experience with linux.<br>
It was setup with a cellphone-like menu, with internet, office and...uh, games....aaaand...office?<br>
These were organized in 4 squares on the screen.<br>
<br>
So, it was very easy to use, but kinda hard to setup, and I had no idea how to install stuff on it.<br>
The guy in the store printed out a few pages fron the internet, with how to's on how to install pirut,<br>
which I think was the package manager for yum. And also how to install amsn, and vlc. <br>
Anyway, that also made it possible for me to change the way it looked and worked.<br>
I got it to have a"normal" dektop!.<br>
Then I found some forum, which said linpus was a tweaked version of fedora(8).<br>
<br>
As I learnt some more stuff, I felt it was kinda hard to work with, so I went searching for a replacement os.<br>
<br>
After a while, I found kuki linux, which is an ubuntu based distro, made for the acer-book.<br>
I was quite happy with that!<br>
<br>
This is where I learnt most of my linux stuff, even if I still don't know a lot.<br>
<br>
Then I installed a 1gb stick of ram (up from 512) and figured I could try windows xp, which worked ok.<br>
Then I found xp-lite, and dual-booted with kuki, and I used that for a while.<br>
<br>
For some reason, I went looking for lightweight linux distros, as I felt my crapbook was net, uh, or...yep...<br>
So... I tried dsl, which don't have wireless(I think) so that was no good for me.<br>
Then slitaz, which I didn't understand, but worked ok.<br>
ooofff...uhm, I think I tried a few others too, but it didn't feel right.<br>
<br>
I decided to just install debian, with xfce, which was ok, but felt kinda slow..<br>
So I installed lxde, and I was happy for a while!<br>
<br>
Then I stumbled across antix when"browsing" the options in unetbootin, that was (and I think it still is) m8.5??<br>
<br>
Later, I found this forum, and found there was a new version, m11, which I love, and used until last week, when I installed 12, or test2, or...??<br>
And here I am!<br>
I still have tons to learn, but I am pretty good at reading instructions...<br>
<br>
I think the most valuable thing I have done on this forum, is: I am not afraid to post about my screwups, and ask about things I don't know, and you people answer!<br>
<br>
Oh, and don't mind my less than great english, as I am... not english.<br>
If you don't"get" what I am trying to say, I won't be offended if you say: WTF ARE YOU SAYING!???!<br>
Or similar...<br>
My name is Kristian, and I am a 32 year old truck driver, with no education.</div>

Me neither. But they put up with my crude ways here. You get nerd/geek credentials from me bumping the ram on that Acer and knowing how to install a running Linux distro on that netbook. Any one here who has the gumption to try a adventure without being afeared of failing. Bonus points for stubborness also. Is alright by me. You don't have to be the sharpest pencil in the cup. Just the hardest. <br>
<br>
Respect and creds to all that wish to try AntiX and find what they have been missing. <br>

<div class="content">Actually, I used to come here but my name and password didn't work anymore. Originally from Knoppix, Kanotix, Sidux, Aptosid, etc and played around with AntiX a bit on my old Compaq laptop. Its been a while so I had to run the ad gauntlet getting signed up again...guess it pays the bills. Just put AntiX-M12 test 2 on a new box...an Intel DN2700MUD mobo (atom cedar trail, dual core ) and here I am. The install went without hitch. The distro is beautiful and I am just getting started exploring it. Right off the bat, suspend seems not to be working...was working fine on the squeeze distro I was running before. I've had some problem getting an install to a 16G USB key but will keep trying on that for a bit. Was hoping to use it as the storage for this bpx but dusted off an old HD for the time being. Amazing to find my old favorites ceni and smxi preloaded in the same distro.<br>
<br>
Tried Knoppix 6.7.1 first, then SalineOS, both worked fine but various things I didn't care for on this. Knoppix has some problems with its repos, it seems and SalineOS, while smooth, has the standard Deb Stable limitations (ancient Iceweasel for one). Siduction 1.1 was a non-starter for some reason...hung during boot so I never got to try it. I will try to live with this for a while as it seems to be maintainable and works pretty well. <br>
<br>
The 2700 is a new thing for me...never dealt with an Intel bios before so that was fun getting started. Love the 10 watts TPD, no fan, and decent speed in the bargain. How DO they do it? Votes are still out on other features but for now, all seem to be working. <br>
<br>
Hats off to anticapitalista...good to see he is still going strong with a real contender in M12.<br>
