<div class="content">yeah. worse than that, i made a respin of antix 16.2 that has petget. <br>
<br>
though that wasnt a specific goal. the goal was to find out how much of mkfigos i would have to modify to make it respin antix (full) instead.<br>
<br>
the changes are here: (then an explanation)<br>

* the goal of this script was to find out how much of mkfigos i would have to modify to make it respin antix.<br>
* this is a fully automated script with no user input. the necessary changes made to it are listed in this post.<br>
* it successfully made a new iso for antix with several changes-- including adding fig, some utilities written in fig, and also petget from puppy linux.<br>
* petget works-- i installed audacious in this"respin" of antix.<br>
* fig os normally mixes librepup with refracta (latest version: 8.3)<br>
* one of the really nice things about the previous version of mkfigos was that it fixed dirty cow before refracta did.<br>
<br>
<br>
the way i started remixing distros was by trying to sort out the differences between all the many puppy versions (even over time, such as very old versions based on the 2.x kernel.)<br>
<br>
i found out no one else was interested in this deep analysis of puppy distros (a little bit surprising, and yet not a lot.) <br>
<br>
i created a utility called"distdiff" which instead of producing a table of things found in many isos, would compare two isos along with the contents of their squashfs files.<br>
<br>
then i watched people struggle to use the official puppy build script. i wanted to find out if there was a way to UPDATE PUPPY by mixing its files with debians. there were two modes; the script took librepup and refracta and made it boot into either:<br>
<br>
* puppy mode: puppy with some parts updated from refracta<br>
* refracta mode: refracta with some parts imported from puppy (like petget)<br>
<br>
it was a race to find out what was easier: update puppy from refracta binaries? or TRULY puppify refracta. refractahrpup could potentially do both. <br>
<br>
<br>
how did it become fig os?<br>
<br>
* no interest in puppifying refracta, even if i was doing all the work<br>
* refracta dev (who ive met in person) thought the name"refractahrpup" might confuse some<br>
* a close friend from the puppy community thought it was better without"puppy" in the name<br>
* ...he made a fig boot screen for me, too<br>
<br>
i updated puppy mode as much as i could-- with TONS of fresh binaries from refracta. it got to where i had to do surgery on initrd; thats where i stopped. with no audience i got as far with puppy mode as i wanted; and dropped the feature.<br>
<br>
when i say"dropped the feature" all i have to do to pick it back up is add some code back. from an older version.<br>
<br>
now ive modified mkfigos to remix antix instead. it doesnt make all the proper edits to antix that it makes to refracta, but i believe it can.<br>
<br>
it makes the new iso-- it boots into the default graphical desktop (with shells and roxterm) and worst of all! it has a working installation of petget. <br>
<br>
i will even attach the source to this bizarre public domain respin code. i made the minimum modifications to get a working, graphical, bootable puppy/antix hybrid. yes! now thats a thing... dont worry, i have no reason to pursue that at this time.</div>

<div class="content">From my perspective, use of petget is worrisome, in the same vein as using/trusting content blindly installed from PPAs (or wget'ted from clowdz).<br>
I do keep an eye on puppyland tech, though<br>

An"adrive" [...]"zdrive" mechanism doesn't jibe well with a dpkg -managed system, but I'd like to work out a way to conditionally side-load<br>
infrequently needed"stuff" during liveboot. (Immediate example is LibreOffice.) Shuffling appimage loaders into, and out of,<br>
a watched directory on the liveUSB should be possible... but I'd prefer an ability to choose"create a diversion" when installing debian packages,<br>
so that LO (and its myriad"personal bloatation devices") could be relegated to a separately-loadable"layer".</div>

<div class="content">a user would be generally unwise to mix apt with puppy packages on an installed system. sooner or later its going to do-- something.<br>
<br>
for a livecd i think its fine, petget happens to be my favourite part of puppy but more importantly, there are many packages for puppy that you can now run-- and when debian drops them in newer versions, theyre still available. i think avidemux is one example.<br>
<br>
not that its ever a great idea to mix repos, let alone package systems. and yet every once in a while, an exception can come up. when i added petget, it was a demo. <br>
<br>
to me, if youre going to mix puppy with anything, you cant have puppy without petget. you probably need a lot of other things, too-- but petget is essential, because people want to be able to use their packages (and a lot the puppy packages are unique, even if compatibility is never guaranteed.)<br>
<br>
if i were going to maintain (rather than just demo) petget or offer it as a serious idea for including, it would need a lot of cleanup. barrys stuff is usually very tightly coupled, difficult to separate into standalone components, and no one seems to have any interest in doing that. i would probably modify petget so that it cant clobber any existing files-- though that would make upgrades difficult or impossible-- petget is designed to clobber. having it check apt to avoid stepping on its toes would be a feat, but probably too much work for something no one would actually use.</div>

<div class="content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
This is my first post, and I've not yet used antiX, although I read some reviews and it looks great..<br>
I particularly like your installer GUI, is it gtkdialog? Is there source available for it?<br>
<br>
...Anyway, about this thread: <strong>I have made a command line package manager for Puppy Linux</strong>.<br>
<br>
Currently found here, in a discussion I'm trying to start about (lack of) Puppy CLI apps:<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=967038#967038"<br>linktext was:"http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic. ... 038#967038"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
It is called Pkg-1.9.0alpha ... It uses some Puppy repo stuff in ~/.packages ... <br>
I wouldn't even think about trying to port it to AntiX until 1.9.1alpha is released.. <br>
<br>
I post about it here because it <em>may</em> be an easier (or not!) way of getting Puppy repos and PETs available in AntiX, <br>
without the need to bring it in PetGet and all its config files, etc.. <br>
<br>
It is currently very, very early alpha stages (only works well on Slacko-6.9.x, which are the latest Slackware based pups)..<br>
But soon it should work work in all recent Puppy Linux builds, and most Woof-built pups (4.3 and later).. <br>
<br>
Anyway, if any mad people on this forum WANT to get Puppy Linux PETs in to AntiX, <br>
this CLI package manager <em>may</em> be something to try... Just FYI.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Good luck on the great looking distro and its excellent custom tools!<br>

<div class="content">Hi, Scott. The antiX installer GUI is written in C++ and has a QT frontend. Its source code is posted here:

<br>
<br>
Source code for most of the antix in-house tools are posted to separate github repos, under antiX-Linux project<br>

<br>
antiX ships with gtkdialog pre-installed. IIRC, it is a slightly higher version (v0.8.3) than most puppy variants use. Its tarball is available here:<br>

<br>
Although the newer version introduces some new functionality and fixes a couple bugs, some quirks arise in puppy applications expecting the older version. An example, from (my) recent memory: <br>
<a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=110097" class="postlink">SFR's <em>Yahtzeeeee</em> game</a><br>
I had to make several modifications to get it to run under antiX, period, and never managed to get it to run flawlessly (roll2, roll3 actions didn't respond). <br>
<br>
Because antiX includes JWM and rox, it may provide a comfortable transition to puppy emigrants.<br>

<div class="content">hi sc0tt, the only real point of having petget in fig os (originally refractahrpup) was to show how you could take barrys stuff and merge it with another distro.<br>
<br>
i dont think theres really anyone on earth who wants to use petget outside of puppy, but if they do its not impossible.<br>
<br>
the point of showing petget in antix was mainly to demonstrate that mkfigos works on antix-- i normally use it with refracta. just to reiterate, i have scripts that used to merge puppy (librepup, based on puppy tahr) with debian-based distros like refracta and antix. dont get me wrong, being able to install .pet packages that easily has actually helped one or two times. have fun.</div>

We added a command-line Debian package manager to antiX-17.    It is written in Bash and makes use of a fairly powerful library that is available here:
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://github.com/BitJam/cli-shell-utils"<br>linktext was:" cli-shell-utils"<br>====================================<br>
.   IIRC, four of our programs use this library now: cli-aptiX, live-usb-maker, dd-live-usb, and live-kernel-updater.   The UI elements are all menus that are navigated with the arrow keys, etc.   I made a screenshot to show you the UI but I was not able to attach it.</div>

Cheers for the links to your GitHub stuff, I will have a good look around, already seen some nice stuff!<br>
<br>
As for many people not wanting to use PetGet, that includes some Puppy users too I think! :)<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

<div class="content">at least its not called pupget anymore (or more importantly, theyre not called"pups") <br>
