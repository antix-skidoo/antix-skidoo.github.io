<div class="content">I'm a total noob who just became aware of Antix and MEPIS. I'm unskilled enough that I don't care if I ever have to use the terminal, though that may be unrealistic. In a quest to find a user friendly desk-top environment, I landed here after trying out several flavors of Ubuntu and Puppy Linux. For some reason, Puppy and I didn't get along well (probably user error). I stumbled onto Antix and so far, it's the first distro I've used that just plain works the way it's supposed to out of the box. Of all the other Linux distros, it's the only one that made my sound work on my Compaq Pressario. I haven't had time to try it yet, but I'm hoping it automatically recognizes my wireless network - Xubuntu 10.1 is the only other one to do that so far. However, I do have several questions...<br>
<br>
1.) The icons on my desktop are rather small and hard on my almost 60 year old eyes. Would changing the screen resolution help that or is there another solution?<br>
<br>
2.) One of several projects planned for this distro is to install it on an ancient"E-Machine" for a relative. This computer has proven to be rather dumb and slow with Xubuntu installed, and seems rather sensative to the cache filling up with cookies causing the internet to slow down. I didn't immediately see a cache cleaning program similar to Ubuntu's"Clean Sweep". Is something like that available for download?<br>
<br>
3.) Other projects include a"dual boot" along side Xubuntu on my Compaq and my brother's computer. However, I recall seeing in the install guide that when installing along side another flavor of Linux, the boot command for the second Linux doesn't happen automatically and must be manually entered in. Could someone take me by the hand and walk me through this step by step? Please don't leave anything out and please don't assume that I automatically know how to do something that you didn't mention - I don't! Thanks in advance for your help.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome to antiX.<br>
<br>
I presume you are using the latest antiX-M11-pt1. You can tell by opeming a terminal and typing inxi -F<br>
<br>
1. Yes that should help. You could also change the icon size by using bigger icons.<br>
<br>
2. The browser used has a clean cookies option in Tools<br>
<br>
3. antiX should pick up the other linux distro, but if it doesn't it should only involve a simple edit.</div>

Don't be afeared Dan. It won't bite'cha. You'll get all kinds of help here. Even from un-em-educated me.<br>
<br>
The Emachine may be a pebble in the shoe to deal with (funny hardware). But there is always someone here who will try and lead ya down the road (could be a dead end, no guarantees, but you won't know till ya try). You will be pleased though once you learn the ropes on the blazing speed of AntiX. It uses less ram than Puppy (I know because I run both and checked with <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>free</code></pre></div>Just be patient with us and AntiX. You might be suprised at how much you learn. I know I am. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
