<div class="content">Hello all,<br>
<br>
I don't seem to be getting on very well with the single click acting on an object immediately, is it possible to have the first click select and a second click to take an action?<br>
<br>
It must be supposed that everyone else is just used to it, but right now it's making my transition from windows a bit error prone.<br>
<br>
Can MX-15 be configured to work this way? I'd be able to feel more at home with it if it could.<br>
<br>
Tried some searches but to be honest I'm not completely sure what I should be searching for yet.<br>
<br>
Oh and it's mostly in the file manager I seem to need this more than anywhere else.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Ian</div>

No problem. Its in Desktop Setting&gt;Icon tab. Here's a screen shot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
check out my youtube channel for a ton of mx/xfce/antix videos. this playlist might be of interest to you. its for MX-14, but most of it is still true.<br>

ugg, bandwidth caps are the worst!<br>
<br>
In case you missed it on the welcome screen, the mx-manual is included in the iso. I believe its under Help in the menu, or just fire up mx-welcome and click on the manual button. There is a ton in there to help as well (although its prettty large. cntrl-f is your friend for searching the thing.)</div>

Yeah, capped at 1gb day time (09:00-24:00) 2gb night time (00:00-09:00), this is per day btw. Not great really. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
<br>
I was able to see some now, and I can only congratulate you on a job well done, shall watch most eventually, and have already passed the link to a mate of mine in the USA.<br>
<br>
Oh, shall go look into that manual, had not expected it to just be there!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the tips and for the videos. Desktop is looking more like something I could call home as a result of watching those! A few things have changed in MX-15, but mostly it's good to just use right away! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Still got the mouse buttons reversed, no clues as to how to fix that despite what Chris said in the other thread. But heck it's fairly minor for now I guess.<br>
<br>
Oh well, sleep beckons!</div>
