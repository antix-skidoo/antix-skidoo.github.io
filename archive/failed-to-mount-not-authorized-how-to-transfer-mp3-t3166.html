<div class="content">antiX-M11 256 megs RAM 600 MHz CPU I'm trying to transfer mp3 music files using Kingston 2G USB thumb drive. Message received is Failed to mount"Kingston". Not Authorized. I guess because it is not automounting ? This is a deal killer. What do I need to do to be able to insert a USB drive, have it automatically detected and mounted then transfer files onto the hard drive. I like a file manager where two panes pop up if possible instead of having to open 2 copies of the file manager.</div>

<div class="content">You may have to open as root user. Try this to see if t works.<br>
<br>
From menu, click Run, type thunar and check open as root.<br>
You should be prompted for your password and thunar opens.<br>
Plug in usb stick.<br>
See if thunar is now able to mount.<br>
Open rox (as user) and copy from thunar to rox.<br>
Not ideal, but to see if it does work.<br>
<br>
You may want to install xfe. This has 2 panes. Others prefer pcmanfm.<br>
<br>
There are ways to automount, but the one used in antiX-M11 was not used as it seems to clash with thunar. If you do not use thunar, but prefer rox or xfe/mc do this. <br>
<br>
As root, edit line 22 and replace word demo to your user name from file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usbstorage.rules.unused and save the edited file as 99-usbstorage.rules in the same directory.<br>
<br>
You should now have automonting in rox-filer.</div>

There was no flashing light on the USB stick as normally happens when I plugged it in. It did not show up on the ROOT page I had open (the one with the red warning I was actually working as root) However when I opened another instance under user (Kay) the Kingston Data DID show up but I was unable to mount so I closed down the machine and took out the Kingston USB 2G data stick.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rats now I've lost the rest of your instructions I wanted to quote. Anyhow what I did next was powered on the machine and went into Ctrl/Alt/F2 and signed in as root then used nano to open the file you named. Couldn't find the line numbers nor the word demo but did see my user name Kay so I saved under the new file name. While hunting for the correct file I somehow came across an option to change the font size so I tried 16 then 14 then closed and forgot where that was. Next I tried to shutdown. It wouldn't quit so I had to physically press the case off button. Power on again and insert Kingston. This screenshop shows where I am. Everything is showing up except the only option is Cancel. Yes is greyed out (don't know if the shot shows that distinctly)<br>
<br>
I think I'm getting close. Thanks ever so much for your reply. <br>
What should I do next.<br>

<div class="content">That image looks like it is showing copying going from usb stick to home Music folder. I guess it will be slow to transfer the files as you probably have usb1, so just wait until it has finished.</div>

It is working now. I seem to have both ROX and Thunar automounting if that is possible. Ten minutes for the total music transfer and not one blink of the Kingston indicator light. I'm listening to music now on the Compag 5BW127 even as I type on my main machine. I'm thrilled as I had already tried pacman which didn't work and as I recall xfe wouldn't download. Your screenshot was so much bigger and nicer than my first try. Once I get the screen resolution permanently opening at 1024x768 it will be ready for it's young new owner and it is all thanks to this forum. I hope she can install her own printer as I don't think anyone I know personally has tried antiX-M11 in this town.<br>
Thanks everyone !</div>
