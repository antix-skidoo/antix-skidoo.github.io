<div class="content">Hello all! Long time no write. I'm needing of your help again. <br>
<br>
Now each time I open audacious, with the icon in systray -or how that is called-, system force-closes itself! While another similar program deadbeef does not do that. So I don't think it's system tray.<br>
Here are the last 30 lines of logs.<br>

Last things I did these past 2 weeks:<br>
wine was giving me headaches with some application (winuni some industrial board programmer/sim; app closes whenever changing between windows); they recommended to reinstall this machine's x drivers:<br>
&gt; apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-video-intel libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri<br>
&gt; dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg<br>
But that didn't solve the problem. So in the end to meet deadlines I gave up, unninstaled wine, and lended a windows machine.<br>
When I wanted to use audacious to listen to some music with my playlists, x closes. What!?<br>
Everytime I open audacious, that thing happens!<br>
So i searched for an alternative, a portable application (deadbeef) and that does not give me this issue.<br>
I fear dpkg-reconfigure did something bad to this PC; I would like to revert old configuration (with wine problems still if I ever use that again), at least linux programs must work! (for now, only 1)<br>
Thank you for your patience.<br>
<br>
(In the meantime, I'll try reinstalling audacious; hopefully that circunvents my long stand with graphic drivers)</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>anticapitalista wrote:</cite>Firstly, it looks like you are logging in as root? if so, why?</div></blockquote>
Ahh no!<br>
This is a misunderstanding I guess.<br>
I executed terminal as root, so I can tail those logs; otherwise, 'access denied' when I open/try to view them.<br>
But then I ran the offending application, at which everything closes (i.e. big commandline screen as if when logout).<br>
(I suppose that is what you mean when those logs say 'session closed for user root' ??? Or I'm mistaken)<br>
<br>
To update my original post:<br>
Reinstalling audacious &amp; plugins does not improve the situation.<br>
It seem that ocurrence is random; I've been opening many programs to test if it's graphics issue or gtk-something, but the best I can pinpoint is, SOMETIMES, but always with audacious when showing notification bubble ('track is playing'), the X session closes.<br>
Programs I've tried: mirage, mtpaint, bless, geany, MANY instances of spacefm, many (not so) terminals, chrome (youtube etc), and some games (preferably fullscreen); but they slow-down this PC so much (30 windows total, to stress the driver), but no X-restart with them. Sometimes I start audacious with them, sometimes I don't, and even then no crash of X server. Of six tries, 5 of them crash X, all of them with audacious running, even after half-an hour after login. (THe other try, I closed audacious after some time, so no crash due to that I wondered)<br>
In the meantime, I'm using iceWM as WM, then I'll probably reinstall JWM; all I can say on this is that JWM has some problem with audacious or some of its plugins so maybe the opposite would lift the crash ~!??<br>
I'll update/reply when testing that scenario.<br>
Thanks for reply.<br>
<br>
UPDATE_1<br>
kern.log now says this, after another force-close (audacious again):
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>May  4 21:08:10 U3 kernel: [ 3249.919727] jwm[2458]: segfault at 18 ip 8004bd6a sp bf9f4ad0 error 4 in jwm (deleted)[8002e000+2f000]
</code></pre></div>
(Other lines are no related/not from same hour/minute)<br>
So, only reinstalling JWM does not solve the problem. Maybe resetting JWM configs/settings. But before that, I will test on iceWM and FB. Not daring to reset MY custom setting, yet.<br>
To clarify if it's not yet: audacious starts in system tray (near the clock, lower-right of screen). I disabled popup in audacious config. Closed audacious. This time, after starting it, when I click on its tray icon, whole X crash again. (This time, not even 10 seconds since it started.)<br>
<br>
UPDATE_2<br>
So, X crashes when I MOVE the mouse OVER audacious' tray icon. AND NOT everytime. I'm still on JWM.</div>

<div class="content">1) Try unchecking"Scroll song title" options under Settings.Appearance.General tab).<br>
2) Try turning off all audacious"visualization" options (in Settings.Appearance.Visualization tab).<br>
3) Try changing audacious's interface (ie. gtk -&gt; qt, or winamp classic -&gt; gtk, etc. - the 3 choices)<br>
4) If all else fails AND you are using the Winamp Skins ("classic") interface, try uninstalling Audacious, Audacious-plugins, and libaudcore, and try installing my forked version called Fauxdacious (which includes additional features, like video playback option). Then, add the line:<br>
<br>
afterstep=TRUE<br>
<br>
under the [Skins] section in your ~/.config/audacious/config file.<br>
<br>
I've run into some similar X-issues involving the way Audacious handles window events and added this option for my rather old window-manager which had issues with Audacious, and I created this option which fixed it by slightly changing the way window events are handled. It MAY or may not be related to or fix your issue, but may be worth a try. I say the Winamp Skins interface b/c I believe the code I changed only effects that interface (I think) and my tarballs were not compiled with the QT option. After uninstalling the audacious packages, fetch the 2 tarballs (linked to from below) and run make, and sudo make install for each (you should already have all the dependencies, since audacious would not've installed w/o bringing them in). If you change you mind, it tells you how to remove them and re-install audacious.<br>

<div class="content">Thank you wildstar84 for your reply.<br>
<br>
Good to see a (due, guess) fork of audacious (though according to what you explain in your blog, it seems to me more of a branch than a fork, or maybe I misunderstand terminology, but I digress)<br>
<br>
On your suggestions; I did 1), 2) &amp; 3), and those did not make any difference. 4) is an insteresting suggestion, but for now I'll keep audacious around, as iceWM does not give me this difficulty. I'll take your experience on X-issues into account, though, for when the time comes due.<br>
<br>
To summarize: The segfault is caused with JWM, according to kern.log /dmesg (<em>Sorry anticapitalista I forgot about this command, no root needed with it !</em>), and always on the popup (even when DISABLED in audacious: just move mouse over tray icon, and I'm back at CLI &amp; slim.). And the worst of this is, NOT everytime, as in, 5 of 6 attempts it crashes at the first moment I put cursor over icon; the other times, after next 1 or 2 moves over the icon.<br>
<br>
For now I'm using iceWM and no issues here (maybe it was time for me to start using the other wm's antiX has to offer <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span>), so maybe this"bug" is a regression ??<br>
<br>
This is a log from 4 weeks ago from Synaptic; that was the set of updates I did before I encountered this issue. As I've been experimenting with deadbeef (and not paying too much attention to audacious) over these past weeks, I could not anticipate the problem, it was just recently that I started to run audacious again for playlist export. My guess is that some of those libxxx listed down here causes the bug on JWM.

<div class="content">That makes me think of one more thing to check (in jwm) - do you have any"balloons" turned on? Usually, when hovering over something that's what, if anything, will get activated. If so, might want to try with all balloons off. As far as Fauxdacious, it is a fork, b/c I'm working independently from the Audacious developers. I took their code at v3.6 and have now taken it in a slightly different direction while still cherry-picking their commits for my updates, but the version numbering is not in sync. As time goes on, the two projects are likely to further diverge some. We now have most of their 3.8 commits implemented. Since both projects are open-source, I'll continue stealing their improvements (that I want) and continue offering new features I add to them for consideration.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you again for your reply.<br>
You wont believe what I just did! <strong>I reset BIOS factory settings</strong>. <em>(On the analogous suggestion they give for windows users, barring formatting the PC.)</em> And, when accidentally logged in JWM (I cound find the moment to edit my ini files as of today), I decided to open audacious, just to reaffirm the scenario. However, surprise for me, no bubbles (balloons as many call them) did pou up whenever mouse moves over tray icon. Restest and retest, and after half-an hour, no crash yet! I cannot tell which hardware setting did this process effect, neither which kernel module changes behavior due to this. Maybe this kernel is too much advanced for this HW (thinkpad g40). The last think I would have done was to reset my config files, which took me great deal of time to prepare, all while learning the semantics of scripting and bash.<br>
I'll mark this thread as solved, although I'm reluctant to do so, as I don't call a change of hardware setting a solution to a software issue. I also don't think my wine issues will end with this change, so I leave those as they are, while I prepare more time in advance to start thinking about tinkering them, as I have other tasks to sort.<br>
Additionally, thank you for your explanation on the branch/fork part, as it helped me clarify some ideas I had about the concept.<br>
