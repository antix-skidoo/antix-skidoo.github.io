<div class="content">Hi Me again!<br>
AntiX 13.2<br>
I am trying to get Iceweasel to play You tube videos but the Flashplayer symbol is showing on all videos so i guess something is out of date<br>
I have installed Chromium but like Iceweasel also and just to learn and figure out how to do this anyway <br>
I have tried to install the latest nonfree Plugin by using the terminalusing the apt-get nonfree plugin command But it says it is the latest version<br>
Also i noticed Iceweasel is out of date anyway as some of the extensions are older versions <br>
Is there a simple way to update Flash on Iceweasel and also update Iceweasel Itself or indeed install Firefox and keep it up to date<br>
I have looked around for solutions but threads on things like this just get longer and longer with people just adding different ways of doing things and it becomes more confusing than it should be<br>
<br>
ALSO<br>
i keep reading that you can add items to your etc apt sources list but have no idea how to do this where i find it or where to start !<br>
<br>
Thanks alot</div>

<div class="content">A couple of notes:<br>
<br>
1. Iceweasel has a flashblock app installed. Sometimes it has problems. You can disable the app in the iceweasel preferences. That will probably be enough to get flash running after you restart iceweasel.<br>
<br>
2. you may also want to update flash player. This command entered at the terminal as root user will let you update flashplayer: as root: <br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>update-flashplugin-nonfree --install</code></pre></div>
3. Let's kill two birds with one stone with you question about adding sources and get iceweasel updated at the same time.<br>
<br>
If you use your filemanager to navigate to <em>/</em>etc/apt/sources.list.d you will find several files with .list extenstions on them (antix.list, debian.list, and various.list if I remember correctly). These are the files to which you can add source definitions. debian-type sources usually start with the"deb" indicator in front. You can look in these files and see how they are laid out. These files are accessible either directly with a text editor or through a handy link in the control center: Edit Config Files on the System Tab.<br>
<br>
I like to enable the mozilla-backports repo to get the latest iceweasel (equivalent to the latest firefox). So let's do that:<br>
<br>
1. Open control center and click on the system tab and then"edit config files". It it will ask for your ROOT password. Enter that and you should get a screen like this:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Notice the tabs across the top of the text editor. Several are sources files with .list extension. <strong>One will be for various.list</strong>. Click on that. It should look like this:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Notice the line with the following:<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># latest (beta) iceweasel
#deb http://mozilla.debian.net/ experimental iceweasel-beta
</code></pre></div>
The # marks indicate the source definition is commented out and disabled so its not polled by any of the package managers.<br>
<br>
we can remove the # mark and save the file. That activates the source, but we have to refresh what the package managers know about. So we can either"reload" in synaptic or as root at the terminal<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>apt-get update
</code></pre></div>
to bring the list of available apps up to date. You can then in synaptic mark iceweasel to be updated with a right click and apply to update to the latest.<br>
<br>
4. The definition by default in various.list is for the beta track of iceweasel. If you want the latest stable version (which is what I run) you can change the definition to the following:<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>deb http://mozilla.debian.net/ wheezy-backports iceweasel-release
</code></pre></div>
keep in mind there is a space between the / and wheezy-backports in the above examples. It would look like this when complete:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Then using synaptic, hit the"reload" button and then find iceweasel in the list, right click on it, and select upgrade. Hit"apply" and away you go.</div>

Dolphin Thankyou again for your quick help and patience i did try the update-flashplugin-nonfree --install command but it tells me its the up to date version i didnt even think of checking Iceweasel for a flash Blocker as i hadnt got round to installing my usual add ons becasue i downloaded Chromium and thought i would have to use that ..Disabling the flashblocker worked and youtube videos now play... i shall play around with the adding sources in the morning<br>
Thanks again its much appreciated</div>
