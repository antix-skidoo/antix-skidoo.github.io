<div class="content">As for Dave reminding me, I had posted this tip in the wrong thread and so here it is:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hi Dave, Linux Mint as we know just released a Debian based version. And as a big community now we get alot of info. Who would guess it would be so easy to install the proprietary ATI driver:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1. Open Synaptic Package Manager and search for: fglrx-control (it will install all necessary fglrx packages) and Apply.<br>
<br>
2. Open up a terminal type the following 2 commands.<br>
su<br>
aticonfig --initial<br>
<br>
3. ctrl+alt+backspace (restart x)</div></blockquote>

Already the new 10.8 driver so it works with HD5000 series. Just saying, not that you should mess with your daughter's laptop again.</div></blockquote></div>

<div class="content">Thanks secipolla for reposting. I was just going to add a link tonight. <br>
<br>
As as aside: My younger daughter accidentally bumped my older daughter's old laptop off a table and made it unbootable. It was backed up, but not very recently. Needless to say the HD was pretty much destroyed.<br>
I managed to get most of the important files off with my handy-dandy antix-M8.5 update iso. before it sounded like a blender and to test its components out. All seemed well except for the HD.<br>
<br>
I was only able to do that because of all the help I received from this great forum. Thanks everyone for your patience.<br>
<br>
Well anyway, I picked up a new 320 GB hard drive and replaced the destroyed 60 GB one.<br>
<br>
After scolding my younger daughter for being careless and then her giving me a few buck towards the new HD, she now dual boots XP and antiX M8.5 on the old Toshiba A105-S210.<br>
AntiX runs great on it.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I'm back at this again ,but using antiX 8.5.<br>
I installed the fglrx packages via Synaptic but when I tried to ctrl+alt+backspace (restart x) I got the login screen.<br>
I'm not really sure of how to get out of this. It seems that I am having the same problem as this individual from this mint post.<br>

SattalanFear from that post says:<br>
"Ah... sorry, looks like either I did something stupid or the package manager did. Probably me, but I don't know how.<br>
<br>
I went to install the ssh server so I could more easily pull data off of the logs and it announced that it hadn't finished configuring the driver, and proceeded to build it. I dunno how I interrupted it, or if for some reason it decided not to finish during installation. Once it was done, I tried relaunching gdm3 and everything was working."<br>
<br>
I have since reinstalled since I couldn't log back into X. Any suggestions would be appreciated. <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<div class="content">Well, I decided to give the ATI driver from Synaptic one last shot. Everything seemed to install correctly. When I booted back up I could not boot into X. Before I rebooted, though, I checked the System Information in the antiXCC and there was no driver in the Display information...completely wiped clean. So, since I was already dropped out of X, I decided to give another shot at sgfxi. I chose the Intel Driver option rather than the ATI. Well much to my surprise, a new opensource driver from Tungsten Graphics was added and it works better than the original Mesa Project Software Rasterizer. I'm not sure why. Both are the same version. 2.1 Mesa 7.7.1.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm thinking that the fglrx driver that I was hoping for probably will not work on my system...unless someone has a tip.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Dave<br>

<br>
EDIT: Hmm...After trying to use sgfxi and install the proprietary Nvidia driver on my desktop for another distro and having it fail in the same manner, I knew that I had to do more research.<br>
I discovered that there is an issue with the nouveau driver and learned that I needed to blacklist it before I could install the propriety driver. For the particular debian distro I was installing, I basically followed this LM post.<br>

<br>
<br>
This worked for me for my Nvidia driver. I don't know if it will work for fglrx driver and if it even pertains to antiX and the Kernel. That will need to wait for my daughter to come home for Christmas.<br>
<br>
The saga continues...<br>
