<div class="content">I'm looking for a backup distro in case anything were to ever happen to CrunchBang Linux, my favorite distro. I tried SparkyLinux, but the installer had issues under one of my laptops, so I decided to take a look at antiX.<br>
<br>
My Linux experience began back in 1994/1995 with Mandrake. I still remember purchasing a boxed set of discs and instruction manual at CompUSA (chain of computer stores in the U.S. that no longer exists). I got home, loaded the OS, and thought to myself,"You've got to be kidding me." I quickly decided that this Linux thing wasn't for me.<br>
<br>
I gave Linux another try when Ubuntu began attracting attention. I installed it in a dual-boot environment and was fairly impressed. I also learned about Kubuntu, Lubuntu, and Xubuntu at this time and tried all three as well. However, I ran into instances where I wasn't able to do something under Linux that I could easily do in Windows, and decided once again that Linux wasn't for me.<br>
<br>
In April 2010, I purchased an ASUS EeePC. Windows XP ran slowly on the ASUS EeePC, so I did some research and came across a Linux distro called CrunchBang Linux. At the time, it was based on Ubuntu. I installed CrunchBang in a dual-boot environment with Windows XP and was blown away. Everything, and I mean everything, worked out of the box. Eventually, I decided that I just didn't have the time to tinker with Linux and removed the CrunchBang partition from my EeePC.<br>
<br>
In November/December 2011, I installed a preview release of Windows 8 in VirtualBox. I had read about the new Metro interface and I didn't think I would like it based on what I had read. Well, my experience with the preview release confirmed my suspicions. I hated the Metro interface. I then decided to give Linux another look and typed the URL for CrunchBang Linux into a browser to see if they were still around. They were and the distro was now based on Debian Stable.<br>
<br>
I started out with CrunchBang running under VirtualBox. In March 2012, I decided to dual-boot CrunchBang Linux and Windows 7 on my main laptop. I have been using CrunchBang Linux ever since. CrunchBang Linux became my primary OS this past summer when I figured out how to access peripherals in Windows 7 running under VirtualBox. I even put a 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=36436"<br>linktext was:"how-to together"<br>====================================<br>
 on the Tips, Tricks, &amp; Scripts forum on the CrunchBang Linux site.<br>
<br>
Other distros that I've played around with over the years: Antergos, BackTrack, Clonezilla, GoboLinux, KNOPPIX, LinuxBBQ, Linux Mint, MEPIS, OpenSUSE, PCLinuxOS, Salix, siduction, SolydXK, SystemRescueCD, Tails, and VSIDO.<br>
<br>
I'm currently customizing my antiX 13.2 Full install to look like CrunchBang, installing desired apps, and purging undesired apps. I like the experience I've had with antiX so far and especially enjoy having newer packages. Debian Stable with select apps from Backports is okay, but still not as up-to-date as Debian Testing. I also like the fact that antiX can be used with the Debian Stable, Testing, or Unstable repos.<br>
<br>
One request I would like to make is that antiX Base be kept up-to-date. Looking through the"what's new" for the 13.x releases of antiX Full, I see some of the features would be nice to have for antiX Base. I would have preferred antiX Base over antiX Full as I'm now spending time removing a number of packages that I don't want.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome and howdy. AntiX isn't one of those distros that are updated every 30 seconds, hence it stays stable. You could also have started with Core and added from there. Or worked with Base and added or deleted from there. All in all, antiX is very customizable for your needs.</div>

<div class="content">I tend to install 13.1 base, &amp; then dist-upgrade if I want it upto date, as it gets older that may not work, but been good so far. <br>
I came to antiX from #! as well, &amp; whilst I still think it a very good distro, my preference for Fluxbox has kept me here. <br>
Each to their own, that's the beauty of FOSS.<span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">@jdmeaux1952: I attempted to install antiX 13 Core 4 different times on my other laptop early this morning. First goof was my fault. Last three were antiX. I specifically selected the Dvorak keyboard layout during the installation routine. However, each time when I booted into the system, the keyboard layout was U.S. I attempted to resolve the issue by editing and saving the etc/default/keyboard file and setting the variant option to"dvorak". Rebooted the laptop and when I got to the login screen, I could enter my username as though the dvorak keyboard layout was in effect, but I could not enter my password. I tried entering my password as though the Qwerty layout was in effect, but that didn't work either. I've given up on this. I'll just install antiX 13.2 Full.<br>
<br>
It's a good thing Core wasn't my first experience with antiX. Good example of why I suggested keeping the Core spin updated as well.<br>
<br>
@fatmac: I don't care for fluxbox. I've tried it a number of times and it's just not my cup of tea. Regarding CrunchBang, you could easily install fluxbox on it, although it would entail some effort to remove openbox and tint2 and then install fluxbox and configure it.</div>
