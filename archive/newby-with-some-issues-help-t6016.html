<div class="content">First, I'd like to say, that AntiX linux is an amazing OS. I'm fairly new to linux, but this is one of the best ones I've come across. Anyway, I am running Antix 15 from a flash drive, and I have set up root persistence. I've come accross a few issues. 1, I need to restart CUPS, every time I boot into root persistence. Any ideas on how to keep CUPS connected to localhost, permanently? 2, once I had everything set up the way I wanted it, I went to try and update, and upgrade the distro, but after I ran,"sudo apt-get update", then,"sudo apt-get dist-upgrade", icons in the control centre, were just red"x"s, and Antix will no longer shut down, when the icon was clicked, overall behavior is"off". and 3, when setting up root persistence, it automatically creates an .ext4 file system. Ext4 isn't really designed for flash drives, it's like NTFS, it's a journal writing system that shortens a flash drive's life. Keep up the good work, with AntiX, I'm still a fan, even with a few glitches. Thank you.</div>

<div class="content">the"startup services" (or whatever it's called) in controlCentre enables you to mark CUPS etc to autostart.<br>
(In my recollection, it's set to autostart by default. Maybe that setting got distrubed by something you installed or upgraded?)<br>
<br>
"sudo apt-get update", then,"sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"<br>
yeah, from past lessons learned, I avoid dist-upgrade.<br>
Earlier today I was wondering: What might break if someone running live winds up upgrading to jessie's v6.03 extlinux and syslinux?<br>
<br>
red"x"s, and Antix will no longer shut down...<br>
Hopefully someone else knows an easy solution. I don't.<br>
In that situation, I would be viewing all the /root/.synaptic/*.log files (if synaptic was used) to see what recently got installed/upgraded<br>
or /var/cache/apt ? /var/log/dpkg ? (I'm drawing a blank as to where the non-synaptic log resides)<br>
<br>
"when setting up root persistence, it automatically creates an .ext4 file system"<br>
Thanks for mentioning. I've already posted asking devs to reconsider that"forced choice".<br>
At some point I was told (or I read) that we can"just turn off the ext4 journaling, ifns ya want"... but I expect"just" amounts to unpacking the initrd,<br>
finding the lines containing the mount commands, editing, repacking, followed by fingers-crossed smoketesting.<br>
Maybe there's a slick way to disable journaling via a boot cheat code?<br>
Anyhow, for me the consolation is that because I'm running dynamic root persistence (writes occur only during persist-save ops) the journaling is a non-issue</div>
