<div class="content">And here's the next problem. I receive zipped logfiles by mail on a regular basis. Attached is a particularly simple example. It opens in Archive Manager (file-roller) but when I want to unpack one of the textfiles in it, I only see two charachters: ÿp (always the same). I tested that the zip archive is basically OK. I can detach the file from the mail in Antix, and unpack it in Ubuntu (where it is shown correctly). Or I can detach the .zip-file in Ubuntu, save it, and when I try to unpack it in Antix I again get a seemingly two-character textfile showing 'ÿp'.<br>
<br>
Any ideas?</div>

clue:<br>
zipfile contains one or more files whose names bear unicode characters<br>
or the zipfile name itself contains unicode characters.<br>

FWIW, I encounter same problem using 7zip or winrar (older version) under winXP.<br>
Other than renaming a zipfile before attemping extraction, I don't know a fix.</div>

<div class="content">I don't think this is an issue with the compression tools. I assume you are using leafpad to open the text document in antiX. try using geany instead. leafpad appears to have a problem with the encoding of the file. geany reports the encoding of your text file to be UTF-16LE (with BOM) while other text files that open OK in leafpad are UTF-8 (without BOM). Now I'm no expert, but I would offer also that the files open just fine in windows notepad as well. Curiousity: are these files generated by an apple/MAC app? nano won't open the file properly either, but it tries to convert from a MAC format (or at least it says it tries).<br>
<br>
Here's a screenshot of the file open in geany, and in leafpad. FWIW, gedit (the default editor for ubuntu) also opens the file correctly.<br>

mousepad (from the xfce folks) opens that file correctly as well. which installs fewer depends than gedit.<br>
<br>
edit* - wow, just looked up leafpad and saw that it hasn't had an update since 2009! Is that right?</div>

I think size was the main culprint. That and antiX-proper has had leafpad for years. Leafpad also had some gtk problems early in antiX 15 development.</div>

<div class="content">That's good news (it being leafpad that is the culprit here). Thank you all for this quick diagnosis.<br>
<br>
The zip-files are generated on a Windows 2008 server machine and normally contain a detailed log of a daily backup operation. During weekends no actual backup is made, and it just sends one line ("The operation completed succesfully").</div>

<div class="content">In view of the above I tried to change my default text editor. First surprise: geany already was listed as default. I quickly realised other programs may have their own defaults. I didn't take me long to find the one for Spacefm: under the menu /View/Preferences/Advanced I found a text box where leafpad %f is listed as default editor. Second surprise: changing that to geany %f didn't change anything, apparently. Doubleclicking a .txt-file still opened it in leafpad. Even rebooting the system didn't change that.<br>
<br>
I even thought about just removing leafpad, and installing a different editor instead. No shortage there, isn't it?. But I reconsidered (wisely perhaps?) when marking leafpad for removal in Synaptics automatically included AntixCC in the list of packages to be purged. Is that the case with all the default packages that come with Antix? (I mean: that you can't easily remove them?)<br>

you've discovered one of the drawbacks of a WM-only system vs. a full desktop environment. I can give you some tips.<br>
<br>
1. in spacefm, you can right click a file and you will see the range of apps that will open that file. select"choose" and you can select an app and click a checkbox to set it as the default. this will update the mimetype database system wide, but rox does not respect that fully (rox is its own beast in a lot of ways, both good and bad), so apps have to be set manually in each file manager. <br>
<br>
2. the field you found in spacefm preferences for the editor is for the right-click&gt;edit function. <br>
<br>
3. in rox-filer, you can specify an app by rightclicking and selecting"Set Run Action" and filing in the info in the dialog box that will result.<br>
<br>
4. leafpad is listed as a dependency of antix control center, so yes, you'll need to leave it installed or antix control center will be removed. That can possibly be looked at in the future. <br>
<br>
5. The default apps selection area you access controls what apps are launched from the links in the menu. so if you change Editor to geany (or rather don't change it from geany) you'll find that the Editor entry on the menu launches geany. The other entries (Web Browser, File Manager, etc...) work the same way.</div>
