<div class="content">For various reasons, I want to setup some kind of printer discovery - at least to figure out the printer's IP address. (As opposed asking the router's DHCP server what address it assigned - which is not possible on somebody else's LAN)<br>
<br>
I see that AntiX has libavahi-client3 installed by default, so I figured the printer tool would be able to find the printer given any of several host names the printer claims: npiff843f.local, deskjet.local, hp5850.local, 5850.local, hp5800.local, 5800.local and several others I could think of. Did not work.<br>
<br>
I found and installed mdns-scan. It found the printer and all the computers - except the AntiX system.<br>
<br>
I tried the funny names (like [0c:09:a4:86:54:ca]._printer._tcp.local) that mdns-scan listed. Still did not work.<br>
<br>
I tried all these various names in FireFox (the printer has a built in http server), also did not work.<br>
<br>
I then found and installed libnss-mdns. After the install was complete, the antiX computer started being listed by mdns-scan. The only other difference I could see is that the installation updated the /etc/nsswitch.conf file.<br>
<br>
Even after rebooting at various points after installing things, nothing could find the printer (except via IP address).<br>
<br>
So far, nothing I've found by googling has suggested anything that I haven't already done (or was done automatically).<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?</div>
