<br>
The planet will just end up devoid of life.</div></blockquote>
I love how easily you brush off all those factors of life that cause pain in favor of pollyanna pipe dreams. Because the next generation has to"Help their elders." How does it not"make sense" to stop perpetuating pain and agony for your so-called loved ones? Furthermore there is nothing bad about nonexistence as my original topic post explains. Happiness doesn't need to exist because it serves no purpose and MUST coincide with even greater amounts of pain. Nothing suffers from not being born. Quality of life has only gotten worse with overpopulation and I think to argue that is absurd (personally here in California wide open space is quickly disappearing due to breeder psychos). <br>
<br>
Keep making the same old arguments for"tradition" and"the beauty of nature." No really, it just gives me more YT video ideas.<br>
<br>
edit: for a simplified video that basically covers my stance on the naturalism fallacy

Negative bummer personality? You're just plainly and simply looking at life from a fantastical point of view, as if we're at Disneyworld and all the bombings in the middle east are just fireworks... enjoy the show! Like I said I won't be going anywhere (other than perhaps banned from this forum for not fitting in to the social hierarchy properly).<br>
<br>
And puritan... naw <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I can be a pretty sick fuck but I just don't abuse women by using them like an object to perpetuate endless DNA trophy nihilism. I associate boobs with women being treated as second class citizens; according to society they are only supposed to drain milk from their ever-inflating breasts and do everything their patriarch tells them to do. So because of that the sight of big boobs makes me feel ill. Pregnancy has extremely negative short term and long term health effects on women but of course I've only ever heard a woman say that so what do they know right? <strong>sarcasm</strong><br>

Look at all the comments with more than one asterisk in them. I didn't do that. They were edited after the fact by someone else <span style="color: #BF40FF">(edit: nope, see below)</span>. Needlessly I might add. I can't speak without cursing here and there. I don't need it all the time like a potty mouth but I just want my due respect to not be censored.</div>

<br>
<br>
As you may have noticed, we have started to filter certain questionable words from appearing in posts. We are also begin to filtering adult images. The words and content are still posted, but they are filtered from view. There are a couple of reasons why the filters are in place.<br>
<br>
1) The Terms of Service do not allow for for obscene and vulgar language or content. To help insure no one is offended by the language, we are inserting"***" so the meaning is conveyed with the use of the actual words. If a post contains too many vulgar or hateful words/images, it will likely trigger the entire post to be removed.<br>
<br>
2) The other reason for implementing the filters, being perfectly honest, is financial. Advertisers do not allow their ads to appear next to content that is deemed obscene or vulgar. And to help insure the content is eligible for advertising, we are filtering the words and images.<br>
<br>
Alternatives to see unfiltered content:<br>
<br>
If the board elects to pay for an ad free site, then content will not be filtered<br>
In the next couple of weeks, we will add an option to allow boards that elect to have ad-free, also elect to only see filtered content.<br>
<br>
Thank you for understanding the need to provide a safe environment for members and for advertisers.

<div class="content">wow, how did i miss this thread, (been off the forum for a while thats how). <br>
<br>
First...this philosophy sounds more like a justification to rant off about a sordid personal existence, according to this philosophy would suicide be an ideal? As anti said utter drivel. Regarding your claim that mankind has done nothing in its existence I suggest you look at Professor Joseph Needhams research into the vast history of China, most of what you are using today Including that computer is thanks to the ancient Chinese. They did far more then paper and compass etc... <br>
<br>
On the contrary humans are the highest being on this planet at least, and for now at least, the Bonobo ape does have some intensely aware eyes though. <br>
