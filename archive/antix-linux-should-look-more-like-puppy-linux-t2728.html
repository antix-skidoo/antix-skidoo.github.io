<div class="content">When I install antiX Linux, I ALWAYS change the default desktop (or lack thereof). I've always had a preference for having clickable icons on the screen, and I suspect the same is also true of our target markets - Windows users, Puppy Linux users who want a better repository, and Ubuntu/Mint users who need something more lightweight. (Remember that Ubuntu/Mint requirements keep growing in size while eliminating support for older versions. This means that a portion of their users get cut off each year and have to find a new distro or buy a newer computer.)<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I NEVER change the default desktop when I install Puppy Linux. It's easier and more convenient to click on an icon than to have to right-click or to click on the Start/menu button at the bottom left corner of the screen. Puppy Linux provides an icon for all of the most widely used functions - network connections, word processing, spreadsheets, GUI directory navigator, shell, web browser, email client, etc.<br>
<br>
While it's easy to change antiX Linux to provide the ROX desktop, I think this should be the default option. antiX Linux doesn't feel any slower with the ROX desktop than it does without it. Having the desktop would appeal to Linux newbies as well as users spoiled by Puppy Linux, Ubuntu/Mint, and other distros that have a default desktop. Even the ultra-light 50MB Damn Small Linux offered a desktop environment and proved that KDE, GNOME, and XFCE aren't the only ways to do this.<br>
<br>
I know that the change I'm calling for is superficial, but it would give first-time antiX Linux users a very positive first impression of this distro, and it would be VERY easy to execute this given what's already in place. Giving antiX Linux more of the Puppy Linux look and feel doesn't require adding drivers for finding lightweight alternatives to bloatware. I see this change as a no-brainer for the next version.</div>

<div class="content">I know that many of you like the flexibility of antiX Linux, and so do I. However, I do not believe that giving antiX Linux the Puppy-like appearance/feel would reduce the flexibility for experienced users like ourselves. (After all, it is easy for us to turn off ROX and make the change permanent. I'm sure also that an antiX Linux user could use KDE, though that defeats the point of using antiX instead of MEPIS.) Given that user-friendliness is one of our selling points (the reason this distro is derived directly from MEPIS), we should appeal to the first-time users. Debian, Arch, Gentoo, and Slackware don't need to be user-friendly because they target savvy users who know what they're doing and want lots of flexibility.</div>

<div class="content">What is funny is I run Puppy Linux. But either run E17 or Icewm with no Icons as I like looking at my Wallpaper free of Icons.<br>
<br>
You say tomato while I say toomayto. To each their own I guess. Whether Fluxbox,Ratpoison,DWM,JWM,Rox Pinboard,Pcmanfm Desktop. Run what ya brung/want I say.<br>
<br>
Puppy runs JWM rox pinboard out of the box. It does this out of lightness. But Icewm and Fluxbox are light and easy to learn also. Neither are user unfriendly and Anti has made them so easy to tweak and configure also. Which helped make me savvy. The guys here can tell you how wet behind the ears I was when I first started using this distro. AntiX has taught me more about using a distro more than any other including Puppy (which I like using by the way. I even use Puppy icewm themes in AntiX). I like Slitaz also.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents jhsu. Don't take offense. <br>

Happy Trails, Rok</div>

<div class="content">I'm not so sure that antiX is pointed towards windows users or any other specific user at all. It's just another option(a better one of course).<br>
<br>
Myself, I don't like icons on my desktop, never did. I don't user either of the default WM's, instead I use XFCE. If I put icons on the desktop then I would have to close a window or two to use them.</div>

<div class="content">I happen to agree with Erie. I also don't like icons on my desktop (in fact just posted by DWM desktop; from a custom install of DMW not the package included in Antix). Yet it is certainly easy enough to add rox or lxde or xfce or whatever.<br>
<br>
I don't see the need for Antix to look more like Puppy or any other distro. In fact, I think a better question might be: why doesn't puppy linux, ubuntu, mint, etc, look and act more like Antix? Perhaps the campaign can be started from that end instead <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>

<div class="content">jhsu, if I may make a Suggestion.<br>
<br>
While you are finding what is good about other distrubutions that you are looking at it, and you see any sort of item thatyou think would benefit antix, you should start a poll. It is my belief that if you start polls on what is better, you will recieve the input of every antix user. For example you are really pushing the idea that antiX should have desktop icons as a default, others are saying that it shouldn't. If you would put it in a poll it will better show the opinion of the antiX community, not only your opinion.<br>
<br>
I am not going to disagree nor agree with you but I think that you should allow everyone to decide, andi think the best way to do this is through a poll</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone for the nice civil discussion about this. It is one of the things that I really appreciate about both antiX and SimplyMEPIS user communities.<br>
Dave, GREAT suggestion!<br>
<br>
jhsu, while based on this topic, it may seem that your view is a minority view, it may have more traction than any of us think right now. As Dave so kindly suggested, taking a poll may help us better understand what others may be looking for.<br>
<br>
Some time ago, anticapitalista used only the Fluxbox window manager and that was his preference. I was one of the ones lobbying for the addition of IceWM and its selection as the default window manager, on the basis of"ease of use". Later, I made a suggestion to replace the combination of Iceweasel and Claws Mail with Seamonkey or the Iceape variation because they have a familiar (Mozilla) interface, but the suite includes Mail, Web Page Composer, and IRC Chat as well as a browser, so anti bit on that suggestion too.<br>
<br>
I have not yet looked into your idea, but bantering it about, then raising it to a poll is a good idea.<br>
<br>
But suppose that it doesn't quite work out. No reason that we can't spawn a remix using your idea. Check around here. You will notice that there are some tools out there to remaster distributions. The MEPIS Lovers Community has not only spawned this antiX community, which is still closely associated with the MEPIS Lovers, yet increasingly independent, but there have been all kinds of spin offs and remastering efforts, mostly"unofficial" ones, but still published with a link to download locations. Examples have included several"Danum" KDE respins, especially early on when few were willing to try KDE 4."Marcos" created a number of excellent respins, including Xfce and LXDE respins of SimplyMEPIS. Worst case, I could see you (or perhaps a kind soul, if you lack the expertise or the time), to create a mock up, proof of concept (PoC) or just a remaster or respin, and let people give it a try. Who knows, depending on the interest, that might even be a"best case" scenario.<br>
<br>
Wherever it goes, let's just share ideas and see what happens.</div>
