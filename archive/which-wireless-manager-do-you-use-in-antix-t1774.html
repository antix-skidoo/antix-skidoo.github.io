<div class="content">What wireless front end do you use to connect in anitX and why?<br>
<br>
Mnetwork<br>
Wicd<br>
Ceni<br>
<br>
I personally have used all three at various times, when I'm on the road, (travel a lot), I sometimes have to use anyone of the three to get connected, but generally when using wpa, ceni will connect efficiently and quickly. I use it at home, and once set it will reconnect seamlessly.<br>

<div class="content">I have used all three in the past. Primarily I use wicd to connect at home and the shop as they will connect automatically. Ceni has worked when I was in a troubled network(don't know why). Mnetwork worked great when I was using Mepis but with other options I find it a little cumbersome these days and tough to find out why it won't connect when it fails.</div>

<div class="content">When I first tried antix about 2 years ago - when the wall was black with the antix logo in the bottom right corner - I used mnetwork. However, it had a tendency to drop connections. So I dropped mnetwork.<br>
<br>
When I install from base, I use ceni to update the system as much as possible (using apt-get via the cli). Then I install wicd from the repos. After reboot I use only wicd. It works wonderfully for me and it looks and runs like apps I see in ubuntu or mandriva. I really don't need anything else.<br>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>mariel77 wrote:</cite>I still use rutilt because it first worked for me when nothing else would. If I really have issues connecting, I use ceni.</div></blockquote>
Interesting! I had not run across anyone who had used rutilt. When did you first find it and start using it? When I got into wireless a few years ago, I started poking around, looking for what others were using. For the most part, people used whatever was in their distro, but I did see a few people looking at wifi-radar, wicd, and kwifi-manager. I found more people happy with wicd than anything else. In the MEPIS community, at least until the last year or so, people seemed to like mnetworks.<br>
<br>
Personally, I was happy with mnetworks until this past year; it used to be reliable, it became less so somewhere along the way. I've found wicd and ceni to be consistently reliable. There was one quirk with wicd at the time when the interface was changing. That was quickly resolved by some astute posts in various forums - probably here, among other places.<br>
<br>
To this day, whether it is ceni or wicd, I get reliable service, so I don't go looking around for other services; what I have works - and I have two choices.</div>

Actually, rutilt is in antiX 8 test3 as well as earlier versions, have a look: Applications&gt;System&gt;Hardware, I have used it in Puppy, a few years back and had acutally forgotten about it, as I never use it, but thanks Mariel for reminding me and glad you found something that works for you.<br>

Thanks, oldhoghead, you are right; I had never looked for it since wicd and ceni have worked so well for me, but I am glad that it was there so that mariel77 could use it. Thanks for pointing out the navigation to me. It shows that even in a modest sized distribution l use but a percentage of the total applications that are available. That's one reason that I appreciate the smaller distributions; I don't use all of the stuff anyway.</div>

<div class="content">I have used rutilt ever since I first used antiX which was when it first came out - 7 beta? Anyway I first installed it from the repos because it was recommended by 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com"<br>linktext was:"http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com"<br>====================================<br>
; I used an rt driver from them for my usb wireless at the time. And I couldn't get mnetwork or wicd to connect for me. I use a different laptop with built-in wireless now, but since rutilt came with antiX by that time, I just kept using it. I only use wireless when I am out somewhere working; I don't have it at home. So that's why I haven't really tried anything else lately; I need to use it when I'm out and don't have time to try something new.</div>

<div class="content">I used Rutilt for the first time today on a Wireless B Netgear MA 401 16 bit PCMCIA Card with a Orinco Chipset. I was booted up with AntiX 8.2 Prefinal Full Iso. The Old IBM 390E , 366 mhz, 198 mbram, 3gig HD. Handled AntiX Latest just fine. Kudos To You guys as always. I'd buy the beers.<br>
<br>
Lspci Picked it up. Wicd wouldn't see my home router. Ceni wouldn't either(except for one time?). Rutilt did and gave signal strength but no IP address. Went to menu section where it said connection was down. Clicked on the down button to bring it to up. All I got was a Code error 3 message Window for my efforts. It was close to working but no cigar. I had to Use a Xircom Ethernet PCMCIA Cardbus Modem to connect to Hardine. It is a old IBM 390 Laptop with just a dialup jack for a modem and USB or PCMCIA is the only way to connect up at my place with it. I give it a E for effort because wicd and ceni saw no wireless signal. Though once, after trying to scan with ceni , 3 or 4 times , it saw my router but still wouldn't connect. WICD is still my preference on all my other gear though. When it works, it works.<br>
<br>
Card works on other Laptops with other distros on em so I know the card is good. It is no big deal as I was just testing it out more than anything as a experiment. The wife has absconded the laptop from me since I had fixed it up. She Likes the 14.1" screen and will have me beef up the ram and hardrive, and to your guys horror, she is gonna install Windows 2000 Pro on it. So no sweating it.</div>
