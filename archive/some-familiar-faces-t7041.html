<div class="content">i know several people here, though only one for sure knows me from this handle.<br>
<br>
im not trying to be sneaky, just using the handle i use most these days. hi to the people i know from puppy, and also hi to the people i know from the devuan-based forums. <br>
<br>
im told antix (or mx) is one of the better distros out there. people keep telling me the difference. id probably favour whichever one is lower on resources, but ive got multiple cores on this thing.</div>

<div class="content">AntiX uses less resources than MX, AntiX is mainly designed for older machines, but of course a lot of us use it on more modern &amp; it flies along. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
MX was produced in collaboration with the Mepis community when that ceased to be maintained, &amp; is aimed at the regular desktop user, but is still easy on resources.<br>
<br>
I used to always start with AntiX Base, which had fewer installed programs, but was fully usable out of the box - kind of like looking at VUU-DO &amp; Refracta. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

this is pretty much my philosophy. i mean i could bloat these cores with a slower de, but what do i get for it? <br>
<br>
i have a theory that most people like something thats slow enough for them to not know what theyre doing. i mean (at least some) windows users want to be able to look down at the keyboard or mouse, do something, and not have anything happen:<br>
<br>
"what did it do?"<br>
-"it loaded your file."<br>
<br>
"why? why did it do that now?"<br>
-"because you opened it."<br>
<br>
<br>
until they can look back up at the screen. <br>
<br>
touchscreens are no better. people want to be able to jab the wrong thing several times, and have the thing wait until they get it right.<br>
<br>
"is that your final answer?"<br>
<br>
"yes, please open that one! ignore the other things i touched."<br>
<br>
<br>
people that actually want to use a computer are the opposite way. they want the response of a stick-gear, not the inefficiency of an automatic.<br>
<br>
"why is it taking so long when i do this?"<br>
-"it took 12 milliseconds."<br>
<br>
"do you have ANY IDEA how long that is?"<br>
<br>
<br>
i dont press a key to take a number and stand in line, i press keys to do stuff. hopefully if i need a delay i will have to press enter to say"yes! thats my final answer!"<br>
<br>
"are you sure?"<br>
<br>
"stop toying with me and do what i say, computer!"<br>
<br>
<br>
its a confidence thing. confident users want things to happen. less confident users want a minute-- and they want to feel like theres 12 millisecond wait on everything, even if they wont be able to change their mind anyway.<br>
<br>
as long as they feel like theres still time to fix whatever they did wrong, thats good enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
and im against camera-based interfaces, but they would solve this once and for all.<br>
<br>
wait until the user is looking at the screen to change the interface. (and the longer it takes them to look, the more milliseconds to add to the pause or it will still be too fast.)<br>
<br>
a confident computer user will already be looking at the screen, if only to keep it from waiting. a"normal user" will be relieved that it isnt doing things before they are"ready" for the computer to do work.<br>
<br>
it would have to keep working after they looked away again. otherwise it would create a new breed of people that stare at their computer like they do at the microwave, hoping it will cook something for a faster version of 2 minutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
im still against any interface that is unpredictable. if it becomes too"smart" it becomes unpredictable, which is a very annoying quality in a computer. its one of the few things noobs and experts agree on:"do what i want!"<br>
<br>
linus torvalds thinks im unreasonable to hate windows. why wouldnt i hate windows? it refuses to do what i tell it to whenever it feels like something from its real masters is more important; it"borrows" my computer and doesnt ever give it back.<br>
<br>
"bend over mr. jones, its time to upgrade to windows 10..."<br>
<br>
<br>
a mac can get away with that because every mac is like a celebrity."oh, youre going to run updates now? thats so cool! can you autograph my butt?"</div>

<div class="content">welcome! (mx is based on antiX-core, and there is quite a bit of cross pollination these days).<br>
<br>
with antiX 17 in play (currently alpha3), its a good time to join this forum!</div>
