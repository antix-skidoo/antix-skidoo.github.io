<div class="content">Hello everyone!<br>
<br>
I'm 31, French, I came to linux in january 2011, and I'm on AntiX since Mai 2012.<br>
I came to linux because, like many others, I was upset to get my old computer not usable with Windows. <br>
And I was not kind with big factory like MS and Apple, I went to Linux after some people told me that's now, it's easy (I was just a simple computer user).<br>
<br>
So, as I was suprised that everything worked with Ubuntu 10.10, and surprised also that it was very easy to use and to take control, I wanted to look for a distro that's would be able to run on a old computer. <br>
<br>
I'm very frustrated that all the society is ruled by the"planned obscolescence", that I'm looking for any solution to avoid it, and to promote these solution to people"who don't know".<br>
<br>
My aim is to show to people that's the program but not the computer that is slow, and convince them to go to the free solution, linux.<br>
<br>
I don't believe in"massive revolution". If there is one, I'm sure that it will be"controlled" or"manipulated" by the elite, in order to install the system they want. So I think that the only efficient solution is to change ourselves and our friends/familly in order to be more independant from"the system". So Linux, and especially the light distros reflect exactly this feeling.<br>
<br>
So I tried Xubuntu/ Lubuntu, but not really satisfying.<br>
I discovered rapidly in Feb Crunchbang 10 alpha2, that I like very much, but it was still difficult to use at this time for me.<br>
<br>
Then, I discovered Puppy linux world, that is really a amazing stuff easy for beginners and very useful disto.<br>
Then I use for one year Crunchbang as main distro, which I learn a lot with configuration file and other stuff.<br>
<br>
I don't understand why I only discoverd Antix after 1 year and 5 mouths, with"Swift linux" that impressed me, even it's not really goodlooking. Well, AntiX correspond exactly to what I was looking for, and it's really beautiful and well finished! A complete, easy and very light Linux distro. And it allow me to learn and discover others nice apps like command line apps that work nicely on extreme old computer, and to do everything with my keyboard thank to IceWM! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Well it's a great distro, and I could use the testing branch of Debian, that I could'nt managed on my crunchbang.<br>
<br>
So congratulations for this work! <br>
<br>
It's a long time I wanted to post my presentation, but it's not so easy in English!<br>
<br>
So Cheers, and see you soon!<br>
<br>
Freco.</div>

I don't like planned obsolescence, too and I am disappointed, that Ubuntu needs so much Ram.</div>

Actually, I can understand that some distro can consume lot of ram in order to get an attractive interface for newbies and young people. AntiX for me it just the best way to impress people that a very old computer (more than 10 years) can work properly for a classic usage. The aim is to change people's mind about their"old 3 years old computer" that can be very slow with Windows. <br>

Thanks! I bought the Debian book in French (about Debian 4). Good book!</div>
