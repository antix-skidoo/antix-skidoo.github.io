<div class="content">anti,<br>
<br>
I had never used Iceape prior to 8.5, and I must say that it is much lighter, (resources used) than Iceweasel, or Firefox, so I vote YES to keeping it, as it is as functional as the aforementioned.<br>
<br>
The new menu layout took some getting used to, but, as I acclimated to it I found that it is logical and concise, with the exception that Control Center in IceWM needs to be on the main menu &amp; or on the toolbar, or both. I also prefer the browser on the toolbar in IceWM, as that is one of the most used apps. Of course it is a small matter to add it, but for someone new I belive that the toolbar is the best location.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cents <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>

<div class="content">i'm for the new menus. as for iceape, i found out that i can't use it on a daily basis, because i can't really match the fonts for my liking and it's hurting my eyes. i also use some of the iceweasel's features and addons. but i guess it's a great add for antix, the main people in the forum think soo, we have to see for the rest of the world.</div>

<div class="content">I like the new menus. I don't care one way or the other about Iceape. Its fine and starts faster on my machine. If I want Iceweasel or Firefox, I can add them. I second oldhoghead on the icewm menu items. I use flux, and I tend to forget icewm has a toolbar when I'm using it.</div>

<div class="content">I also vote for iceape. I think the menus are fine, however, I exclusively use fluxbox so I'm not bothered too much about whether there are icons on the toolbar or not. Also, seeing how either menu is fully customizable by the end user, I tend to see the default structure as a starting point.</div>

<div class="content">Browser wise for me its indifferent. Iceweasel has an easier support since its just like Firefox but if Iceape is performing fine its good to leave it since its integration with mail and Chatzilla is good.<br>
As long as the menus aren't lacking that's ok since, as Pedro said, it's a starting point (must be a good starting point). I don't have the live-cd anymore (the one and only cd-rw used for any distro) but if I recall well in the toolbar there was only 'exit' and one more thing, that may be somewhat uneasier to first time users but as people get accustomed to the os it can be fine to have only this minimum set up since we may tend to leave things the way they are and then nothing unneeded will be there. Still, design wise, I find smarter and quicker to make the 'exit' button a kicker style launcher for the exit options, like I posted elsewhere (including screenshot).<br>
The menu setup was very reasonable as I recall but please, I find the following important:<br>
* that the pt_BR apps are with their updated versions (I see that they were downloaded so I suspect it's already fixed) - see the beta 3 thread.<br>
* that all antiX apps have a .desktop file included (maybe not IceWMCC but the standalone ones like mouse config and screenshooter, yes) so they show up in the 'applications' menu. Also please include a .desktop file for ROX-Filer for the same reason. They need only to be in English since the app that generates the relevant sub-menu only reads English regardless of the system locale settings (at least with the live-cd).<br>
<br>
Thank you and congrats on another antiX release.</div>
