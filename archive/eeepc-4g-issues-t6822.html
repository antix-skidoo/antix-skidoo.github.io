<div class="content">I have not found Antix 16.1 or MX16 easy and even getting this far was an effort as I have never joined any forum before.<br>
<br>
I was just trying to find a distro that fitted in 4Gb. I wanted to put /home on an SD card.<br>
<br>
MX16 just would not recognise the SSD (Antix 16 did) and I could only get it to partition the whole SSD card and this took almost 8GB.<br>
<br>
Antix 16.1 also would only let me partition the whole SSD drive so no option to set up /home on SD card. Strangely what I took to be the larger distro fits very well in under 3Gb.<br>
<br>
Worse is that after many many installation attempts I can only log in as demo even though I gave the usual username &amp; password. I edited partition-info, I selected the alternate installer (at least I think I understood the instructions) and tried as many variations as seemed mathematically possible.<br>
<br>
I love this little machine but EasyPeasy has long been dead and finding something a bit less techie than the Puppies has proven difficult.<br>
<br>
Can someone explain what is going on in eiter/both distros so I can use this baby in hospital where a full laptop is impractical and a tablet is a bit limited.<br>
<br>
PS It would have helped in MX16 if I had known that the grey screen with 3 icons would eventually become a sunrise with a full panel but installing via a USB key is slow &amp; I rebooted the first two times as there was neither a cursor or something spinning to show work was continuing.<br>
Could I suggest finding someone who doesn't use these distros to test the installation process. Every program I ever wrote worked if I tested it. It was only when the infinite number of monkeys used it that I found its usability issues.<br>
For this particular topic I am officially a monkey.</div>

@9:30 it shows item"1b" where you have an opportunity to (re)partition the target.<br>
If you didn't do so, and the target contained only one partition... that would explain why only"using entire disk" was offered, right?<br>
("I edited partition-info" is unclear. You did so via the installer workflow, or in advance, prior to running installer?)<br>
<br>
As for home location, you can setup at any time -- not necessary to do so during install.<br>
I've read (and mostly agree) that because most users will not opt to relocate their homedir,<br>
inclusion of that optional step in the installer would add unecessary confusion.<br>
<br>
"I can only log in as demo even though I gave the usual username &amp; password."<br>
Stumped. AFAIK, that aspect of the installer has been thoroughly betatested. Might the sticking point be something simple, like CapsLock?<br>

Although I personally welcomed that visual cue, apparently the stakeholders decided it would be widely regarded as a nuisance.</div>

Yep, as expected, if multiple partitions are recognized, the"custom install using existing partitions" option is offered.<br>
Maybe MrT partitioned but didn't realize the need to mark bootable (set the boot flag) of the intended target?<br>
