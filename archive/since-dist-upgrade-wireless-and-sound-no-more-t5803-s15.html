Exactly!!! I similarly suspect the little blighter has snuck in during a dist-upgrade somehow; but I have not had time to track it down.<br>
<br>
I did an install that ignored the choice of 'testing' and installed 'Jessie/stable'. That's ok for now I thought. I did my 'basic' setup routine that I do post almost any install; then, when I had stuff looking the way I wanted &amp; my essentials installed, I installed a Liquorix kernel (4.04) and did a dist-upgrade to 'testing' from outside X. Changed antix &amp; debian repos only. After reboot, I had no sound AT ALL. Standard Intel onboard sound; never gives a problem. I looked very quickly at the upgrade log and thought I tried all the normal checks mentioned here and elsewhere for sound trouble. Nothing changed it.<br>
<br>
After deciding I was going to reinstall and leave it on Jessie, I thought, why not try pulseaudio before I wipe it. Of course that brought in a swag of systemd stuff so I can no longer prove whether it was there before or not. However, sound worked without a problem, so the dist-upgrade somehow killed alsa?!<br>
<br>
As a separate matter, bringing in a heap of systemd seemed to screw with the graphics under certain themes.<br>
<br>
I am no longer optimistic that running without systemd installed is feasible at any level above Jessie? Just too many variables &amp; inter-dependent changes to catch you up?<br>
<br>
Anyway, FWIW, antix (spacefm/fluxbox) using stable is working just fine at the moment.<br>

I think part of the problem in testing is that packages <em>expect</em> systemd to be available, and antiX ships with the apt settings such that systemd will not come down. <br>
<br>
Things might settle down in a while as testing/stretch matures.</div>

<div class="content">What you write here, I can not understand!<br>
<br>
antiX has chosen V15 against systemd.<br>
<br>
Everyone knows here, Debian has decided with Jessie for systemd.<br>
<br>
The activation of the testing repos sp√ºhlt course systemd packages in the system.<br>
<br>
Have they thought systemd cares about adjusting the sysvinit-scripts in antiX?<br>
Sooner or later they will experience the same with stable...</div>

Nice diagnosis on this matter. I have not yet come across this issue, but I have multiple antiX and MX instances on two different portable systems; some of them are running off the Stable repos and may not be exercising this particular code path, but I have at least one instance somewhere that is or was using Testing, and at one point, I had one or two instances that were using Sid. So eventually I may come across a similar issue and if I do, this is really good information, so I certainly appreciate it!</div>
