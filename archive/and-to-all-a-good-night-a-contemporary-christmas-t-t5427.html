<div class="content">By John Chuckman<br>
<br>
It was only a matter of time before Santa Claus himself came under the Neanderthal-eyed scrutiny of American intelligence. After all, Santa’s citizenship is unknown, and he crosses borders with no passport or other form of identification. No one knows whether he even has a valid pilot’s license.<br>
<br>
Although his image is well known, there is no official photograph on file with American border control, and he has never been fingerprinted or body-searched. Most disconcerting of all, he delivers parcels to children all over the world, including the children living in the Axis of Evil. His intentions with this activity are not understood beyond some fuzzy generalization about kindness and generosity to all. Clearly, here was the world’s largest unplugged pipeline to potential terrorists.<br>
<br>
It was only after receiving no response to several urgent letters from the State Department requesting an immediate meeting in Washington that a decision was made to approach Santa’s North Pole solitude. As usual in such matters with the people now running America, a wing of America’s most lethal killing machines was employed for the purpose. You never know what you might encounter in such a forbidding place.<br>
<br>
As the planes first zoomed over the icy silence of the North Pole workshop, one of the pilots decided to swoop down for a closer look. He was one of those daring fly-boys, and his tail struck the only wire for thousands of miles around, the North Pole Telegraph, sending his plane hurling into the workshop in a ball of flames with tons of ammunition and missiles exploding.<br>
<br>
Santa and Mrs. Claus rushed out of their snow-blanketed gingerbread house to see what was happening, trying to calm the terrified reindeer running from their stable at one end of the house. The elves, too, scurried towards the stable, trying to stop the reindeer from running or flying off.<br>
<br>
Above, in the dark vault of sky, the other pilots observed the explosion and saw missile trails smoking into the air. They also saw the frantic activity below and quickly concluded their comrade had come under anti-aircraft attack. So they swooped down in attack formation, rapid-fire canon tearing into everything ahead of them.<br>
<br>
Most of the reindeer fell in the snow, spurting warm blood across the bluish-white surface. Most of the elves, too, fell gasping for life. Mrs. Claus received a wound in the head and instantly fell limp. Santa tried heroically to reach his wife but realized the situation was hopeless and turned, running into the darkness accompanied by Prancer, the only surviving reindeer.<br>
<br>
The only witness to the massacre is one surviving elf now living somewhere in Canada under an assumed identity, fearful for his life. It is only from his testimony that we know anything about Santa’s fate.<br>
<br>
Realizing the horrific mistake they had made, the pilots dropped white phosphorus bombs with the intention of incinerating all evidence. The entire North Pole lit up and Santa and Prancer could be seen in the distance on a huge block of ice drifting off into the dark sea, the ice everywhere cracked and weakened by the combined effects of white phosphorus and years of global warming.<br>
<br>
Within in a few hours, the beating sound of a black helicopter approached Santa and Prancer. The elf, from his hiding place in a snowdrift, could only make out intermittent sounds across the howling coldness, but it seems armed men emerged from the helicopter, shot Prancer and shackled Santa, shoving him into the dark, beating machine. The elf heard a word that sounded like Guantanamo and Santa has not been heard from since. Reports of his fate reached the International Red Cross and organizations like Amnesty International, leading to inquiries, but these have been met only with silence from American authorities.</div>

My first wife was there that day, and a big copper picked her up and threw her out the doors of Euston station seconds before the bomb went off.<br>
<br>
And what many Londoners will never forget, despite the pathetic weakness of our politicians, is who paid for those bombs. The same nation that <strong>whined and winged</strong> about how"the world has changed" after 911.<br>
<br>
Oh yea, and the Xtians who placed them in position. Nothing new there, was there?<br>

Oh yes, and we got to see on our TV screns, back in the day, all the freedom and democracy America was bringing to Vietnam. Of course, Americans never got to see that, did they?<br>
<br>
And as for the Xtian Nation's own goal on the Xtian enclave in Nagasaki; the only Xtian enclave in Japan. But not many people know about that either.<br>

<div class="content">And on behalf of my second wife, let us not forget the Philippines!<br>
<br>
Whenever the colonial subjects of the U.S. fought back, the U.S. drowned them in blood. As Mark Twain commented on the Philippine war:<br>
<br>
We have pacified some thousands of the islanders and buried them; destroyed their fields; burned their villages, and turned their widows and orphans out-of-doors; furnished heartbreak by exile to some dozens of disagreeable patriots; subjugated the remaining ten millions by Benevolent Assimilation, which is the pious new name of the musket; we have acquired property in the three hundred concubines and other slaves of our business partner, the Sultan of Sulu, and hoisted our protecting flag over that swag.<br>
<br>
And so, by these Providences of God--and the phrase is the government's, not mine--we are a World Power.<br>
<br>
In the 1900-1903 war to conquer the Philippines, the U.S. killed more than 1 million people. In the midst of that war, U.S. Army General Shefter said:"It may be necessary to kill half of the Filipinos in order that the remaining half of the population may be advanced to a higher plane of life than their present semi-barbarous state affords."<br>
<br>
And then we come to the murderous Yankee puppet leader Ferdinand Marcos who butchered some of my wife's family, and when the Filipinoes drove him out, Ronny Raygun and his sidekick Bush gave the murderer a nice home on Hawaii. Amerikkkan Tax dollars at work.<br>
<br>
What you going to do Roky? Censor me? Delate me? Throw me out of the forum?<br>
<br>
It won't change the truth.<br>

Since 1946, the SOA has trained over 64,000 Latin American soldiers in counterinsurgency techniques, sniper training, commando and psychological warfare, military intelligence and interrogation tactics. These graduates have consistently used their skills to wage a war against their own people. Among those targeted by SOA graduates are educators, union organizers, religious workers, student leaders, and others who work for the rights of the poor. <strong>Hundreds of thousands</strong> of Latin Americans have been <strong>tortured, raped, assassinated, “disappeared,” massacred,</strong> and forced into refugee by those trained at the School of Assassins.<br>
