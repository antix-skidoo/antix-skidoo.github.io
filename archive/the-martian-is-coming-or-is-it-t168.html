<div class="content">Looking for tips on setting up an LT Agere Winmodem in Lysistrata. The Martian solution worked for Mepis 6.02 and at one point I had the daemon loaded and running in AntiX but it never actually found the modem.<br>
I have now ruined it so that it will not compile.<br>
Here's what I did:<br>
I downloaded and installed the headers for 2.6.22-1-mepis-smp and the kbuild as well (thanks to the wonders of dpkg)<br>
scanModem is whinning about kernel-source-2.6.22-1-mepis-smp which I cannot find on the repository links in Synaptic.<br>
I did find linux-source-2.6.22_2.6.22-10mepis1_all.deb but when I install that it just puts a zip file in /usr/src/linux/<br>
Believe I will do a reinstall and start from scratch this weekend since at one point I did have the martian daemon installed and running but have mucked with so many things along the way. The install is so quick that it is easier to start again - this is how we learn!<br>
<br>
If anyone has an Ltmodem working on AntiX I would appreciate any tips or tricks on how it was done. Bear with me on posting back since my connectivity is sporadic.<br>
<br>
Also, I am a bit confused on udev and ivman - should I be using both or just one. I enabled ivman in sysvinit and udev starts during boot.<br>
Thanks in advance for any ideas</div>

<div class="content">I have one of those LT Agere modems that worked fine on all versions of Mepis up to 6.0. Some users have had success getting them to work on the 6.x series by installing the right modules (see postings at MepisLovers.org, especially in the Newbie section). <br>
<br>
BUT: I had bad luck trying to get Martian to work in Lysistrata and like an idiot borked my system by trying to install modules for an earlier Linux kernel. So until modem detection gets better I threw in the towel and bought the serial modem that works for me with all versions of Linux I've ever tried (Creative Modem Blaster).<br>
<br>
I say all this because if a serial modem is not for you because you have no serial port, some recent posts at MepisLovers describe great success in using a serial/USB adapter to get serial modems to work. Think about it...<br>
<br>
Edit: Here is a serial/USB adapter thread at MepisLovers: <br>

<div class="content">Thanks malanrich.<br>
I have two serial ports and actually a serial port modem (just need to get it to power up)<br>
I think the main problem I am having is the headers keep changing in the Mepis repository. When I first installed they were at 2.6.22_2.6.22-9 and they very soon changed to 2.6.22_2.6.22-10.<br>
Now they are up to 12 and 14 - I mixed them and that just hosed a lot of things.<br>
It looks like the image has to exactly match the headers and then, of course, I would still need the restricted modules.<br>
Probably should go to a hardware modem but I like challenges and dislike spending money.<br>
anyway, thank you for the reply.</div>

<div class="content">If you have an external serial modem you dont need to compile anything.<br>
The device is /dev/ttyS1 (com2) most probably.<br>
<br>
To use the kernel source you have to unpack the tar.gz file left by the<br>
kernel source package in /usr/src and symlink it to /usr/src/linux.<br>
And get the corresponding headers of course.<br>
<br>
Find a power adapter for that serial modem, thats easiest.</div>
