(and probably for more western countries too. Always in the name of freedom, democracy and human rights, of course).<br>
<br>
Germany? Compared to others not that much. 1863, 1866, 1870/71, the two World Wars and recently against Serbia and Afghanistan. I'd say the two World Wars count a bit, for the long periods it hasn't been in war.<br>
<br>
To me it looks a lot like western imperialism is back (assuming it ever stopped. It probably only knew to hide itself slightly better. No need to hide it anymore, it seems). Like someone else put it: You fear WW3? No worries. We are in the middle of it.</div>

The"money is no object" is also apparent here in the US. We have a Congress who very seldom listens to what the People want, a"President" who has never proved he IS an American citizen and went to university on a foreign-student aid program, a Vice-President who is a moron, and an open spending policy. Spend $3 Billion USD for an industry which couldn't and don't work, and then forgive the loan. Give over 45% of all funds to foreign governments which are hostile to the Peace of the World.

The last time i checked the USA has been a democracy. To vote a president or a party and later complain is a bit strange (though very common in western democracies). <br>
I wouldn't disagree that it supports each and every dictatorship out there. And that it doesn't support democracy, as soon a party gets voted which isn't wanted (who exactly delivered weapons to the taliban back in the 80's ?)<br>
<br>
The rest of the world would consider another country to be hostile to the peace of the world, in case you missed it:<br>

<div class="content">Sigh,<br>
Though I watch RT News from time to time. Because of my family background.<br>
I give State Sponsored Putins RT opinions as much credence as Fox News opnions here in the States.<br>
<br>
Both are governed by outside forces/agendas. I never knew RT was the pulse for how the world thinks either.<br>

Too bad you can't recognize stuff like that nadir. I am not saying we are Saints. But misery loves company and I aint joining.<br>

Edit: as far as your Democracy Statement. That was pretty naive also as the world shows that Democracies can be manipulated <br>

If it helps you: I can tell you for sure that the sympathy for Obama (and the USA) is at the lowest point in decades these days. Pick any paper or magazine you want (Spiegel, Zeit, TAZ, FAZ, ...). You don't need to be a genius to recognize who is in one war after the other. <br>

Sure: it is always someone else who is the culprit. Nothing US citizens could do about (removing the flag from the front door would be a start, if i would be asked).<br>
<br>
PS: German citizens are just the same, btw (Well: they don't see a point in a flag, but else: complain, complain, complain. Then vote for the same people again - with nearly absolute majority. I guess i don't need to explain who exports all those weapons too).</div>

I can only respond to the link you posted. Being a Biker. I don't give a hoot what others think of me in day to day living.<br>
I try and be polite, well mannered.<br>
<br>
But arguing opinions and pointing fingers and doing"burn the witch" with the masses is not my style.<br>
I don't agree with some of the stuff said in this thread.<br>
Just my opinion which like every one else with a sphincter. Everyone has one.<br>
<br>
I am not going to argue with fence posts, scream at the wind, or argue politics. With my neighbors or you.<br>
I am in my own universe, happy and content, and ya'll can go about your business.<br>
<br>
Happy trails, Rok</div>

<div class="content">The thread is about the ongoing wars of the UK (or the will to stop them). Obviously other western countries got similar problems. I pointed that out. <br>
If you don't plan to talk about such -politics, don't post in such threads (if all which can be said is that politics sucks: You might have guessed, i have heard it before). <br>
<br>
I also gave the link to the wikipedia article. I wouldn't call that an opinion, but some simple facts.</div>

I love Pravda. I remember when I lived elsewhere it was such a scary radio station telling me what a capitalist pig I was, and now it has stories likes"Aliens chased America off the moon". Actually now they’ve finally caught on with what I said about the woman from Alabama:<br>

Actually, that great Englishman, Thomas Paine, son of Thetford, where his statue overlooks the town square, said it all about the British Government.<br>

Some would claim it's a Republic, but IMHO it's acquired the state of Empire <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>A distinct set of definitions for the word republic evolved in the United States. In common parlance a republic is a state that does not practice direct democracy but rather has a government indirectly controlled by the people. This understanding of the term was originally developed by James Madison, and notably employed in Federalist Paper No. 10. This meaning was widely adopted early in the history of the United States, including in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828. It was a novel meaning to the term; representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>An empire is a state with politico-military dominion of populations who are culturally and ethnically distinct from the imperial (ruling) ethnic group and its culture[</div></blockquote>
And let's face it, the British Government now always does exactly what our American masters tell them <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
