<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>impuwat wrote:</cite>
I would like to see my royal red fluxbox style listed as one of the available styles. I don't use very many of the styles included with antiX. For some reason many of them either look small and crowded or too large. Which is why I started developing other fluxbox styles. I use the antiX style the most, which is why I modified it into the royal red style. That way I have a style I like in two color variations.</div></blockquote>
I agree. In general, the standard fluxbox styles (that seem to always come with ANY fluxbox installation) are pretty dire! The antiX one is rather refreshing &amp; looks really good, as does the royal red one of yours. <br>
<br>
I have found though, that it's kind of"Screen Dependent" as to how the style looks. On my small (1024x768) screen most styles look really HUGE &amp; not good at all, but the same styles on my 1440x900 screen look fairly even and quite nice, and on the 1680x1050 screen they look GREAT!! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Here's a screenshot of the one that i'm using at the moment (called"Nivitrium") on the 1440 screen, and i've also got it on the 1024 screen, and it's not too bad at all.<br>

<br>
I keep meaning to get into developing my own styles to try &amp; get some the way that i'd like to see them. Just haven't found enough time yet! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">I assumed that was the problem, but have no new high resolution screens to check it out. Some of the styles included with antiX would look much better at greater resolutions. From a poll I took earlier, however, most of us (66% of those responding) are using older equipment and 1024x768.<br>
<br>
Your screenshot of"Nivitrium" looks very nice! Nice proportions, simple, and easy on the eyes...very elegant. Modifying or developing styles is a little bit of a struggle at first but has a quick easy learning curve. My time is much more limited now that the weather is better and more daylight to be outside. I doubt I will get much done on new styles or wallpaper through this summer.</div>

<div class="content">The Red-Royal style created by impuwat is in the final release (there was no way that it would not be included).<br>
<br>
About the styles included, the vast majority are from the basic fluxbox styles installed default (I don't want to delete them as it it part of the fluxbox package).<br>
<br>
I agree that many of the styles 'bundled' with fluxbox are not that good, but they aren't that bad. <br>
Hey, you could be using KDE or Gnome!!</div>

Anticapitalista nevers forget anyone and knows what it is good, he has that keen eye vision.<br>
<br>
You have more experience with Linux than me.<br>
I want it to ask if you know. Can I put the new antiX OS in my pentium 3.ghz cpu, 1.gig ram. I want to start to play with splash screens for antiX. I don't have any idea. Also where I can download the latest AntiX OS? If you can guide me here or anyone. Thanks for the info to whom it may concern.<br>
<br>
Again impuwat Congratulations well done job and also to thank Anticapitalista!</div>

<div class="content">Sakasa, the final antiX-M7.2 will be available very soon ie I hope at the end of this month. <br>
Preview2 is available from these sites:<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/antix/preview/"<br>linktext was:"http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/antix/preview/"<br>====================================<br>

Don't spend too much time developing antiX splash screens, as it doesn't use them! Not that I'm against you doing so, and that others won't use them, but it isn't an integral part of antiX.<br>
<br>
Your Pentium 3Ghz with 1 GB RAM will take off and end up on Mars with antiX on it!!<br>
<br>
99% sure that the default login and wallpaper for antiX-M7.2 will be Sakasa's antix-BTB design. <br>
Other wallpapers will be included.</div>

I had a good laugh... I thought about it, and in this case I will enter myself inside the Computer with antiX.<br>

<br>
Thanks for everything and I'm glad it was some how useful.<br>
<br>
I'm still cracking up here.<br>
