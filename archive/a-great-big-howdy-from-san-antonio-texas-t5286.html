<div class="content">Hi everyone!! Wanted to stop in and say HI before posting my request for help. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
I'm working part time at a local school system out here in big ole Texas. We are trying to utilize some old computer hardware and decided antiX was the best solution for our needs. I already have two computer labs setup (about 50 laptops) with antiX and the students use just the Web browser now to access what is needed. This is working great so far. We are expanding this concept and getting ready to deploy about 60 older desktops with antiX and a Citrix client for other labs. With the Citrix client installed we have many other options available for class use on some very old hardware. Even though it isn't being used on the laptops now, they have the Citrix client to allow other uses. <br>
<br>
Our schools system is a big user of Ghost. Nobody was able to get ghost to backup an antiX install, so before I got here all installs were done from a CD. I did some checking and found CloneZilla did the backup &amp; restore job very nicely, so new setups are cut down to about 10 minutes now. Well, that's my two cents to add. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
The only thing else for me to say now is, <br>
<br>
wait for it . . .<br>
<br>
Live Long and Prosper</div>

<div class="content">If you are using clonesilla to make and deploy multiple computers with the same image, have you considered trying the built in snapshot feature?<br>
Though it is not really meant to be used for a backup, I have found it works well if you have data on a separate partition. Making snapshot of the system partition and transferring that to multiple computers seems to work well. Even for pushing them accross a network.... For accross a network I have setup a script to download the iso from the main server, extract it in my /boot/iso directory, then I have a grub entry to boot that extracted live system into ram. When it is finished copying and extracting the iso the script reboots the computer and there it sits at grub waiting to run through the installer.</div>

Thanks for the thought - got me to thinking about how I was deploying images. I have two 4 Gig USB drives, one has the Clonezilla boot and the other has the image. Just decided to move the image to our server to allow deployment to multiple computers. I just booted from the CloneZilla USB drive and selected Use SAMBA server for the image. When I typed in my network password it connected to the image without a problem, so we no longer need a 2nd drive for image.</div>

<div class="content">LOL I was surprised to see a TEXAN proudly posting here.......and not be ignored!! lol<br>
<br>
I posted this general message in another forum....and the forum which is a cartoon of U.S. liberalism... and it was removed.... but anyway....<br>
<br>
I was hosted by the college whereat am an adjunct physics instructor to give a presentation on my teaching methods for a NISOD meeting in Austin TX last year.......... and was.......amazed by two things...<br>
<br>
A)"wemmin" in the"ozarks" apparently"armour up" in jeans/torn jeans.....sweashirts and t-shirts/torn t-shirts.........I mean EVERY woman in Austin , riding a seque btw, wears a great jersy A-line and the men ALL wear chinos and pastel polo shirts!! lol<br>
<br>
B) Linux in Texas<br>
<br>
i) The drive down, from Missouri ....when I went across the line into Texas.........OMG........the MULTITUDE of BIG HUGE BILLBOARDS........shouting that Gator needs LINUX people........<br>
ii) The Continental Club on University in Austin.....where so MANY bands/singers have launched...........<br>
<br>
THERE WERE NO LESS THAN......TWO people, one guy and one guy and his wife sitting at the bar.......<br>
<br>
Who DO Linux............ one does"security" and the other is big into"biological modeling"........<br>
<br>
BUT.hey I did the whole deploying to workstations at a church school up here in the Show Me State for a church school , and if it hadn't been for a wrangle between the"churchy" OLD GUYS they would have still been running it.........they went to windblows......and then went bankrupt.... lol or .........not lol.....sad really.<br>
