<div class="content">Since Debian plans to freeze Testing/wheezy on 30 June, there are a lot of upgrades coming into Testing, so it is probably wise to release antiX asap after the freeze.<br>
<br>
Those running antiX-12 test versions should be able to just dist-upgrade (and install the latest kernel) to get 99.99% of what is the final release.</div>

John, I've not had problems changing from one Debian repo to another, and some time back in time, I moved from Open Office to Libre Office with no issues; just removed one and added the other.<br>
<br>
As far as the distro repo change, I do it when all three repos (Stable, Testing, and Sid) are in a pretty consistent state; in other words, not in the middle of a big C library change, a Perl or Python migration, or some other huge infrastructure change. Except for those times, I've had no difficulties at all changing from Stable to Testing or Testing to Sid; I may have even gone from Stable to Sid in the past; in any case, I've done 'em several times with no issues.<br>
<br>
I have an antiX core based on Sid, and my current Debian Sid system was actually created with a Debian Live CD that came from Squeeze a few years ago when it was still in Testing; I just changed the repoversion from Testing to Sid, did an apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade, and got lucky: zero issues.<br>
<br>
Timing is everything; don't do that when major changes are in the middle of happening, and you'll be fine.</div>

On my AntiX 8.5 core installs, AntiX 11 installls, I just use Anti's latest kernel. Use Daves repositories to like get/install new features and file managers like SpaceFM and stuff. I dist-upgrade on a regular basis. So my 8.5 and 11 installs are pretty close to being just like AntiX 12. <br>
<br>
Hope that helps you.</div>

@Honeypuck: I completely agree with rokytnji, a.k.a. Roky. I've often gone two or three releases between antiX versions before finally deciding to grab the latest version, though I also do install at least one of the new versions and actually, I install just about every build to help with the testing, but in addition to that, I frequently keep older versions, and sometimes I compare the two. Quite frankly, there is very little difference, If you keep the antiX repository archives enabled and you use Debian Testing as your Debian archive, you can perpetually run the same base system for as long as you want. In order to do that, you just want to exercise a bit of extra caution right around Debian release times, particularly within the next few days to a month or so right after a release, because that's when a flood of new packages and infrastructure changes come into Debian Testing; it's wise in those times to check in Debian and antiX forums to make sure things are"OK", and also learn how to watch which packages are being changed, and whether or not any packages are being removed (and if so, does it make sense for them to be removed).<br>
<br>
With those caveats and precautions, you can either get new distributions every now and then, or run with the ones that you have.<br>
<br>
Roky and I are not the only ones who have used older versions for a long time. Someone I have not seen around here lately, who has, in the past, been among our active contributors, ErieFisher, created his own customized version of antiX, replacing Fluxbox and IceWM with the Xfce desktop and adding his own collection of software. I don't remember him changing antiX versions after that, though he'd pick up a new kernel and things like that when changes occurred.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is that there are many ways to do things. If you're not sure about an idea you're thinking of, please do ask, and if you happen to have spare hardware, just experiment. Worst case then is to start over. (Backups and snapshots are good in such scenarios, and antiX is full of great tools for creating system snapshots).<br>
<br>
To be clear, I have no objection to installing new releases either. I tend to multi-boot seven to ten systems per machine I have, so I often have BOTH the old AND the new, especially when I also use Virtualbox in addition to the disk partition images that I maintain.</div>

<div class="content">An update.<br>
<br>
Wheezy/Testing is now officially frozen. However, that does not mean (at the moment) that there are no upgrades. In fact, since the freeze, many packages have been upgraded eg roxterm, iceweasel etc. My guess is that upgrades will continue for a while and then settle down to next to nothing.<br>
<br>
A question.<br>
<br>
antiX-core-M11 was based on stable whereas full and base were based on Testing. At the moment, antiX-core is based on Testing, just like full and base. <br>
Should the default repo for core be Wheezy rather than Testing in anticipation for when Wheezy goes final in 2013? Thoughts/ideas welcome.<br>
<br>
For those of you using the testing releases of antiX-12 series.<br>
You should be able to just apt-get dist-upgrade to get to what is the final version, except for the kernel. You will have to upgrade it manually. The latest kernel is 3.4.4 and the latest antixsnapshot is for that kernel. antixsnapshot-cli and the kernel image must match for those wishing to make a live iso backup of their installed system.<br>
<br>
There will be quite a few antiX upgrades in the next few days. I have cleaned up some of the scripts and fixed some bugs. You may find, for example, that your sudoers file or apt sources file(s) get changed (if you have made some edits to it after installation). No biggie, just you need to be aware.<br>
<br>
A potential 'biggie' is in upgrading the fluxbox/icewm/jwm menu files. You will be prompted to configure your fluxbox/jwm/icewm menu via the upgrade process.<br>
You should choose the following.<br>
1. When asked for the icon theme, choose gTangish-2.0a1 (Type it correctly or copy/paste)<br>
2. When asked about the sixe of the icons, choose 32x32<br>
3. When asked about the desktop theme, choose preferences-desktop-theme.png<br>
<br>
Do not make any mistakes here! <br>
If you do,<br>
apt-get -f install <br>
<br>
should restart the dialog again.<br>
<br>
Documentation is improved, though it still needs work Unfortunately, it is only in English. Any volunteers to translate (even after we go final) are most welcome.<br>
<br>
For those using antiX-M11 (or earlier, but fully upgraded), I will try and provide a smooth upgrade. Now, the result will not be 100% antiX-12 as released, but very close to it. <br>
For users with antiX-M11 as it came, ie with no upgrades (or very few for whatever reason), it may be best to start with the new antiX-12 version. You should backup your /home/username directory as keeping the old /home directory is not advised. Better to install fresh and copy all your stuff on /home/username after installation.<br>
<br>
All our releases, from Spartacus (6.5) to the latest Jayaben Desaii (11) have been excellent, but, IMO, what we have done in antiX-12 raises the bar even higher.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!</div>

<div class="content">anti, I *so agree* with you! While every release since 2006 has been good, to me, you and each member of the team have learned from each previous release, and this one is outstanding already. At any moment, when you choose to release it, to me, it will be excellent.<br>
<br>
As for me, what I usually do with my systems is this: I generally keep either a base or a full, and keep it connected to Debian Testing, then I also keep either one or two (two at the moment) instances of antiX core, and I tie those to Sid. Either way, all of my antiX releases are rolling releases. Therefore, if and when I have the time, I can replace them with current images (and you know that I always test builds in between releases), but I don't always replace every single one of my instances right away with a new instance. For instance, right now, my"core" versions are both from earlier works; I am happy with them as they are, but I took one of my"full" versions and replaced it with this release's"base" - and I installed yet another copy of"base" on a system I picked up from my sister to configure for Mom; works PERFECTLY; set it up with JWM, auto login, and relabeled a big, fat icon for the Web browser; it's great!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to the"final word", but in the meantime, I am extremely happy with what we have even now!</div>
