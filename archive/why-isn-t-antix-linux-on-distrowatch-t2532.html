<div class="content">Distrowatch seems to be the premier site for ranking Linux distros by popularity. antiX shouldn't be treated as just another version of MEPIS. Remember that Xubuntu and Kubuntu are listed as separate distros even though they are MUCH closer to Ubuntu than antiX is to MEPIS. Even Puppy Linux offshoots MacPup and Quirky have their own spots on Distrowatch. A listing on Distrowatch would provide antiX Linux some much-needed visibility.<br>
<br>
While I wouldn't expect antiX Linux to dethrone Ubuntu from the #1 spot (Ubuntu has so much money behind it), I think Ubuntu can take on all of these distros:<br>
1. SliTaz (#40): It's recommended as a lightweight distro because the ISO is only 30 MB. I tried it, and I couldn't figure out how to do anything other than surf the web. On my computer, the text was so big that I had to keep scrolling to the right in order to read an entire line of text on the browser. At least the default antiX Linux configuration I didn't like (no icons or shortcuts) still allowed me to do what I wanted to do (just not in the most convenient manner). Also, antiX Linux at least makes it reasonably easy to change the configurations that I didn't like. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to make such adjustments in SliTaz. Perhaps if I were using a Windows 95 era machine, I'd have been more motivated to figure out how to use this distro. Damn Small Linux is so much better.<br>
2. TinyMe (#31): I've seen this recommended as a lightweight distro. I haven't tried it, but it's not well-established like antiX.<br>
3. Vector (#27): I haven't tried it, but the Debian repository of antiX Linux is bigger than the Slackware repository of Vector.<br>
4. KNOPPIX (#26): It's popular as a live CD. It's heavyweight, so don't try it with only 256 MB of RAM.<br>
5. Dreamlinux (#24): I've tried it. It's user-friendly, better-looking, and uses the Debian repository, but it's not as lightweight as antiX Linux.<br>
6. CrunchBang (#22): I've tried it. I found it to be slow and not user-friendly. I couldn't figure out how to do anything, not even browse the web. I don't consider this a lightweight alternative to Ubuntu.<br>
7. Lubuntu (#17): This is Ubuntu with LXDE. I haven't tried it, but it's not as lightweight or well-established as antiX Linux.<br>
8. TinyCore (#16): I tried this distro, but I couldn't figure out how to do anything, not even browse the web. Perhaps if I were using a Windows 95 era machine, I'd have been more motivated to figure out how to use this distro. Damn Small Linux is so much better.<br>
9. Puppy Linux (#10): This used to be my main distro. It's very lightweight and user-friendly, but its software repository is still weak.<br>
10. Arch Linux (#9): I haven't tried it, but I've heard great things about it. However, it's not intended for Linux newbies.<br>
11. Debian (#6): It's the basis for many distros, including MEPIS, the parent of antiX. I'm surprised that Debian is #6 given how hard it is to configure. I've tried it, but all that tweaking wasn't for me.</div>
