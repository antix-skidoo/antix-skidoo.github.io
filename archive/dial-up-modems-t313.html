<div class="content">Hello thor.<br>
<br>
I know malanrich uses a modem with antiX, so he and maybe others can help more.<br>
<br>
have a look at this thread, but use the gppp (in menu under dial-up) instead of kppp.<br>
<br>

There is also wvdial (type it in a terminal)<br>

What did Puppy see your modem as and where?<br>

<div class="content">Hi anticapitalista...thanks for a responce and the link...it has links to links I have seen befor and chose the modems I have based on what should work..I thought that it then was a matter of finding a distro that included the drivers for said cards..<br>
<br>
I put damnsmall on a thumb to test boxs and see if the cards worked but did not think the 2.4x kernal would be an issue when I moved on up to a better project box and the 2.6 kernal...<br>
<br>
not sure where the issue rests..as I know the modems are good and worked on linux projects to my knowledge...is it an included drivers issue..the 2.6 kernal..script issue or just my inability to understand how things work..<br>
<br>
as usual so many questions so little time<br>
<br>
the last three modems I tried were<br>
<br>
fm8818 rockwell rcv288dpi l3903-57....this worked for dsl for certain<br>
<br>
diamond supra express 33.6 rockwell 13903-57..chose as the chipset was the same and admitt I did not attemp to dial up puppy although this was in the box..reading suggested complication<br>
<br>
the third was a us robotics 33.6..Oh its back in the other box<br>
<br>
I have a us robotics external which also worked and may play with anti external but desire an internal, use the external on another project<br>
<br>
this box is a p3 600 w/512 , ati rage128, crystal 4281 award bios, the vid and sound appear to be working<br>
<br>
BLABLABLA..I need a break</div>

<div class="content">Hi thor,<br>
<br>
Don't give up on dial-up in antiX. I've used modems with Mepis since MepisLite, Mepis 3.4.3, 6.5, antiX Spartacus and Lysistrata. <br>
<br>
Some Winmodems work fine with early versions of Mepis (through, but not beyond, 3.4.3). From 6.5 on, getting internal modems to work requires configurations described over on the MepisLovers site.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to put the time into getting the internal modem to work, an external that has *always* worked on my Dell desktops is the Creative Modem Blaster. It has worked with all versions of Mepis as well as every version of Linux I've tried. In fact, I ran out of time monkeying with an internal modem that worked on earlier Mepises and just bought another Modem Blaster. It works great with antiX. Moreover, if I want to play with live sessions of other Linux versions, I don't have to worry about whether the modem will work. I haven't given up on the internal (and it looks as though better winmodem detection may be coming along), but to get a *reliable* system up and running, I'd go for a Blaster.<br>
<br>
Note: Of course, this is a *serial* (not USB) modem. I don't think you mentioned whether you have a serial port...</div>

Haveing another look...<br>
could"cannot open the serial port be a permission issue"?<br>
The external serial modem appears to be initialized<br>
would that explain the"please enter passwor" when there is no where to put one?<br>
if so how would I solve<br>
just a thought...still like antix and was waiting for the 7.01 so I could install and download some extras...no point if the modem does not work...have not found a blaster..yet anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Hi thor,<br>
<br>
There are many users at MepisLovers that are more modem-savvy than I am. But let me make a couple of comments that sound simple but may be useful (have patience with me).<br>
<br>
First, I get almost identical log output that you list below (including"cannot set information for serial port"). But my Modem Blaster still connects perfectly. And I had to do almost no configuration.<br>
<br>
There may be differences between our ISP's that prevent you from connecting without more configuration. The part in your log output that differs from mine is the request for password. Now here's where I ask the dumb question: You are using the gnomeppp gui to configure your dialup, right? I know that it still has wvdial as the backend, but I *think* there are differences between getting the modem running with the gnome dialer vs. going through the wvdial setup in terminal. I use wvdial through terminal when running Zenwalk, but gnome-ppp always configures my modem right off in antiX, and it's *much* easier for monkeying with the settings than wvdial setup (for me anyway). <br>

<div class="content">well thanks alot I appreciate your response..I have had a lot of 0 response on the linux forums...the guy laughed when I ask for an external serial modem and it cost 100 bucks so I will regret slamming it to the floor and jumping on the dam* thing. I got it with such excitement thinking of a LINUX desktop work station..what a nerd..I have twelve distros and three installed all are flakey and can not dial a connection...of course thats all my fault or the hardwares fault it seems to work excellent for everyone else..and I have heard your a noob and go back to windows far to many time. I am done..<br>
.sorry for the rant..it's not your fault, I like this distro and likely giveing up just when I found the perfect distro but I gatta go<br>
.thinking of what I could of had for 100 bucks I guess.</div>

<div class="content">Well, you may need to take a break for a while until you decide to give Linux another try. <br>
<br>
But maybe you're close to getting your serial modem to work if all you need to do is open the Gnome dial-up tool from the Lysistrata menu and make sure you set up an account (with user name and password) before trying to dial. <br>
<br>
I don't know where you live, but here in Los Angeles I walk into a Frye's Electronics and buy a Modem Blaster for about $50. It seems to work on all Linuxes. Also you can try ebay.</div>

<div class="content">Internal modems are often"winmodems" and can be problematic. Try this web site for help getting them to work with GNU/Linux:<br>

Another possibility is to buy a PCMCIA/CardBus to PCI adapter and a CardBus modem. CardBus modems typically do not require drivers (they are hardware modems), and work fine with Linux. Before trying this, do some research and make sure that the adapter that you want to buy will work with Linux.<br>

<div class="content">pcalvert and malanarich are right. I am a dial up man from way back when. In Antix (or MEPIS)..using an external serial port modem thus far there have been no problems. In Antix I just went to gppp and it detected the modem. Right now take a break...have a cup of coffee...take walk outside (remember what it looks like?) then when you are rested give Antix or MEPIS a try. Don't give up.....sooner or later you will win! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
