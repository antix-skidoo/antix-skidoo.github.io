<div class="content">Hello, Each...<br>
<br>
I refer you to the following link on speeding-up"low-spec" PCs in SamK's excellent spiel on tweaking best performance from a system. (There is an anecdotal definition on"low-spec" in there too.)<br>
<br>
boot-antix-16b-2-t6356-30.html<br>
<br>
(SamK, love your work!) <br>
<br>
.<br>
Rather than adding the following info <em>there</em> (and detracting from the main issue being discussed) I started this thread instead. <br>
<br>
<br>
Since I am on a lowish-spec system (1GHz single-core CPU; 768MB RAM; 4MB (effective) video card) I have tried some of the things SamK suggested.<br>
<br>
.<br>
I would like to add some things to help too...<br>
<br>
<strong>1.<br>
SERVICES</strong><br>
<br>
SamK, I agree about unnecessary Services, but as a Pnewbie (ie Post-Newbie; silent"N"; copyright waived) I just do not know for sure... <br>
<br>
(i) WHICH Services can <em>safely</em> go OFF; <br>
(ii) KNOW which Services interact (<em>for instance only</em> - some DM during, or just after, boot ?)<br>
(iii) WHY some Services come back On after being turned Off [eg. bluetooth on some distros won't STAY Off] <br>
(iv) WHICH can be permanently removed, and HOW best to do that;<br>
<br>
SamK, some SIMPLE (?rule-of-thumb?) guide-notes on Services would be <em>really</em> a welcome addition to your aforementioned work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>2.<br>
BROWSERS</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>(a.) <br>
"No-install option"</strong><br>
Ability to NOT install the"BIG" web-browsers. In my humble opinion they bring a tonne of stuff to the plate. On"low specs" that's an issue (including when they're started-up too). [However, I believe big browsers might also provide some beneficial processes? files? or other? to the system on install. That would be handy to know too.]<br>
<br>
<strong>(b.) <br>
"Small footprint option"</strong><br>
Instead use OTHER browser install. For instance, I have found <strong>Midori</strong> to be ENTIRELY suitable for <em>my</em> web browsing. I might be a bit unusual (well, for many reasons:) ) but I do not watch flashy videos and stuff as I browse; generally I like to get to the meaty reading in the news and other stories (and of course web-forums). So I don't want the other bulky, muscley, oiled-up, smelly-rippley-fleshed, skitey bigguns.<br>
<br>
<strong>(c).<br>
"Useful plugins etc"</strong><br>
Like Opera of olden times, <strong>Midori</strong> has a fantastic plugin which, when enabled, provides buttons at bottom of the window, and that allows <span style="text-decoration: underline">"Images" to be turned OFF/ON at will</span>. So browsing is fast, <em>really fast</em> (on olde systems). So, as I browse if I like something and want a better view of it, then turn Images ON (and then OFF again afterwards, and keep browsing).<br>
<br>
Hope that helps (too).<br>
<br>
[P.S. On my low-spec system Antix-15 has been pretty darn good. ] <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

Previously I mentioned to you about capitalising prose in your posts. It is seen as shouting and is out of line with the friendliness of the antiX forum. As a newcomer, it might be a product of your enthusiasm for antiX, but it does not encourage participation.<br>
<br>
Examples of good uses of capital letters in posts include acronyms and titles etc.</div>

<div class="content"><strong>SENDER:</strong> boombaby &lt;Note, NO capitals ("NO" is capitalized for emphasis.)&gt;<br>

<strong>RECIPIENT:</strong> SamK &lt;With <strong><em>two</em></strong> capital letters!&gt;<br>

<strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Contrition &lt; Capitalized because it is the Subject heading&gt;<br>
<br>
<strong>TEXT:</strong> I'm SORRY! OK? <br>
&lt;"SORRY", was capitalized there because it is emphasized;"OK" is OK because it is just an acronym&gt;<br>

<div class="content">Boys, Play nice please. So to both of you. Do not jerk the helpful dog chains here. Strife is easy. Cumbyeya is hard. I run a few of low spec AntiX machines myself. (Ibm T23, M&amp;A Companion netbook, Amrel RT 786 toughbook, and Panasonic cf-48 toughbook). Besides other throw away low spec desktop computers. <br>
<br>
SamK. Cut the boy some slack or jerking his chain. Grow some thick skin.<br>
boombaby. Quit teasing the helpful regulars or jerking their chains. Grow some thick skin.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the thread boombaby. SamK. Thanks for the tips. Back to my chores. Somebody has to do the work around here. Happy Trailz, Rok.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah.<br>

I'll be the judge of that. Thank you. Don't sweat it. I am a pretty laid back type of scooter tramp linux user.</div>
