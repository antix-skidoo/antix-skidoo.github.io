<div class="content">First and foremost... congrats to all involved on the wonderful antiX 11 turnout.<br>
I am looking for help in making a distro of my customized setup to port to other computers.<br>
Currently, I am working on setting up some older PII and PIII computers for a day care center. This is voluntary work; the hardware was donated; no monetary exchange. I have one computer set up nicely for preschool ages, using an iceWM setting. There are no programs foreign to what came with antiX 11. I use desktop icons for education and fun; autohidden panel; no Conky display; no dependency on Internet access during usage; so much cuteness that I have nightmares about Elmo. I have hidden most anything that would deter our future Linux geniuses from having a good experience.<br>
Now, as I delve in deeper, I am paranoid that my next step will ruin what I have and force me to start over. I want to create a distro to copy this setup to similar computers, do some testing stages and reload whenever I feel like it.<br>
So I am looking for a distro creator or cloner. I'm leaning heavily on distro. I read up on remastersys but when I added that repo to the source list, I got an error that the line was malformed. I probably did some newbie error. MS has softened my brain over the decades and my Linux customizing experience is limited.<br>
Any one have any suggestions? Many, many thanks in advance,<br>
<br>
Ron</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ron<br>
<br>
I had a look at remastersys, the code, how it works - not really used it.<br>
Maybe you can try to use remastersys, but the Debian version, not the Ubuntu version<br>
<br>
I experimented with a script that comes with antiX, the link:<br>

<div class="content">This is now fairly easy in antiX and will get even easier with the next release. I've done it myself manually using the mksquashfs command with a LiveUSB.<br>
<br>
For a more automated solution, take a look at

 by Dave gives good step by step instructions.<br>
<br>
You will probably need several gigs (or more) of free disk space and the process is cpu intensive because it compresses the entire filesystem so it will fit on a cd. You end up with a .iso file that you can burn to cd (if it is small enough) or use to create a LiveUSB.</div>

<div class="content">Fairly easy? Apparently, you are all in a higher league than I am. I can't even do a successful"sh remaster.sh". I get an error"can't open remaster.sh". Three decades of bowing to MS has turned my mind to mush.<br>
For now, I will just repeat the same steps on each separate computer over and over and over. I would love to get this done right, but it will have to wait. Tell a bunch of moms you can help them and they are your back forever and a day. I will get back to this after I rid myself of the monkeys on my back.<br>
<br>
Thanks all for the advice. <br>

<div class="content">I am not sure about the tools which come with antiX itself.<br>
I do it with live-helper (now also called live-build).<br>
<br>
You install and configure. <br>
You create a working directory, say in your home:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>mkdir ~/Live
cd ~/Live</code></pre></div>
You use live-helper as root to create the installable backup.
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>lh config --debootstrap copy --debian-installer live
lh build</code></pre></div>
you wait. Or, for live-build (simply a newer version of the same tool):
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>lb config --debootstrap copy --debian-installer live
lb build</code></pre></div>
Again wait.<br>
Like mentioned above you will need about three times as much space as you actually use for your install. <br>
Make sure to not store any data you don't need, but only install the system and configure it.<br>
<br>
You will find a lot of how-tos about this way to do it at forums.debian.net, how-to section, or here:<br>

<strong><br>
If it was me i would stick to the tools which come with antix anyway</strong> (for several reasons). But i don't know them. This is simply something you could try. I do it like that in VirtualBox, and create a new CD each month.<br>
remastersys should work fine too, but its been a while.<br>
live-helper can be touchy, especially with non-debian-default kernels (for others it works, for me it doesn't).<br>
<br>
Wait a bit, it might be this is a method which is pointless in antiX. I don't know (but once some people complained when i posted something similar at the Mepis forum, like in"its better to use the tools which are there". I agree, as long it works).<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I get an error"can't open remaster.sh".</div></blockquote>
Did you run it as root?<br>
<br>
The main reason why i post at all: don't give up too early. It is not for super-gurus, but sure a subject which is taking place in the higher leagues (that is: you can run into trouble. a bit of trouble). Let the others help you , best with the script remaster.sh, and you should get it sorted soon.</div>

<div class="content">the other thing one can do:<br>
rsync the install to the other PC (either via lan or via usb-stick/external hard-disk)<br>
boot a live-CD on the other PC.<br>
chroot into the rsynced system<br>
install grub<br>
edit /etc/fstab<br>
remove /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules<br>
exit chroot and reboot<br>
if it went well: good. if not: repair from a live-CD via chroot.<br>
As its not easy i won't tell all of the commands in detail. In case you are desperate you can look into that way too.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the help. I had a little time to play around today so I thought I'd tackle this again. Rather than try the rsync or live-helper, I decided to tackle the remaster issue. Here is what I came up with. I am listing this in relative detail since there seems to be a fair amount of interest in this post and some of the inquiring mines may be as inexperienced as I am.<br>
<br>
I chose Terminal from the main menu.<br>
Typed in sux.<br>
Typed in the root password.<br>
Typed in cd /usr/local/bin (to position myself in the folder where remaster.sh is located).<br>
Typed in remaster.<br>
When asked where the live cd was, I inserted the AntiX M11 live cd and selected /dev/sr0.<br>
Got a message the project will be created in"usr/local/bin/remaster".<br>
At this point, I was temporarily distracted and did not pay attention but eventually AntiX Mountbox asked to"select the media which can be cd, flash or USB device".<br>
I used Mountbox to unmount /dev/sr0, removed the live cd and inserted a blank cd.<br>
I then exited Mountbox.<br>
Got a message Do you want to remove"/root/bash_history"...(Y/n)?<br>
Typed in Y and pressed [Enter].<br>
Got a message Are you ready to start building the iso (Y/n)?<br>
Typed in Y and pressed [Enter].<br>
Got a message Would you like to amend your version File (y/N)?<br>
Typed in N and pressed [Enter].<br>
Got a message The iso file will be placed by default in"usr/local/bin/remaster" directory. Is that OK (Y/n)?<br>
Typed in Y and pressed [Enter].<br>
Got a message Enter the name of the iso file:<br>
Typed in antix2 and pressed [Enter].<br>
Got a message Good. We are now creating your iso...<br>
&lt;After approximately a half hour&gt;<br>
Got a message Done. you will find your very own remastered homemade Linux here: /usr/local/bin/remaster/antix2.iso.<br>
I confirmed the presence of the file by typing in cd remaster then typed in ls. The iso file was there along with a folder called new-iso and a folder called new-squashfs.<br>
<br>
So apparently, typing in remaster while I was in terminal mode as root and located in /usr/local/bin was what I needed to do in lieu of typing in sh remaster.sh. The next steps however were not as successful, so I will detail them in the following post.</div>

<div class="content">Ok, now my bubble has completely burst.<br>
<br>
First, I did the remaster again following my instructions above. Oddly enough, this time I had to type in remaster.sh instead of just remaster. And to avoid swapping CDs around, I installed second CD drive. <br>
I used xfburn from the sound and video menu to burn an iso image. All appeared to work well until I used the CD on another computer. The new iso image comes up the same as the original with the demo login and NONE of my customization.<br>
I repeated the whole process three times and got the same results every time. <br>
I noticed that the remaster folder which was created during the remastering process is hidden and can only be seen if I rox to it with root privileges (terminal / sux /password / cd /usr/local/bin / rox).<br>
<br>
So, what am I doing wrong?</div>

<div class="content">Ok, I see that you have figured out how to make it work... But I am not sure why it is going back to the default .iso image. Anyways I will write out a more detailed step by step to try to help a bit more.<br>
<br>
1. installed antiX on a my testing system, installed and configured as I found fit.<br>
2. opened terminal in my ~/ directory ( verify by typing pwd, output should be /home/USER/ )<br>
3. typed mkdir $home/new-iso <br>
4. type cd $home/new-iso ( verify correct directory, type pwd and the output should now be /home/USER/new-iso )<br>
5. typed su followed by the root password to gain root access <br>
6. ran remaster.sh by typing"remaster.sh"<br>
Followed the steps for remaster.sh....<br>
<br>
There are essentially 2 operating systems installed on your computer, one is the test machine OS, and the other the remaster OS. The test machine OS reside under / and the remaster OS resides under /home/USER/new-iso/remaster/new-squashfs. The goal of steps 7 &amp; 8 are to make the two operating systems the same.<br>
<br>
General rules: <br>
a) all user related config files found in ~/ directory or /home/USER/ go to the /etc/skel folder for the remaster OS or /home/USER/new-iso/remaster/new-squashfs/etc/skel<br>
b) other config files fall into the appropriate directories, EG: /etc/config-example.conf goes to /home/USER/new-iso/remaster/new-squashfs/etc/config-example.conf<br>
c) try to copy only the affected application config files from ~/. You do not need to copy the entirety of ~/ ( This will cause a longer waiting time when making new users, as well as set your locales as default, this may or may not be desired. )<br>
<br>
7. when at the" When done please type"exit" or press CTRL-D" section I began installing my applications as if I were configuring my test machine again using apt.<br>
8. ( Here is where the setup of the test machine comes into play )<br>
After installing all the applications in step 7, I copy the configuration of my test machine ( usually the hidden contents of ~/ directory, or /home/USER/ EG: /home/USER/.config ) to the /home/USER/new-iso/remaster/new-squashfs/etc/skel EG: /home/USER/new-iso/remaster/new-squashfs/etc/skel/.config . This is done by using a file manager as root or in a new terminal. menu --&gt; run | type: gksu FILEMANAGER or menu --&gt; run | type: gksu roxterm<br>
<br>
This is done to be able to have the proper configuration of the applications you wish to run, as you cannot start the application from within remaster.sh.<br>
<br>
9. Once finished installing all the applications ( STEP 7 ) and moving the appropriate config files ( STEP 8 ) you may now press CTRL-D or type exit and follow through with the options<br>
10. burn the new iso image ( within the /home/USER/new-iso/ directory, unless otherwise specified )<br>
!*!# As a tip, use a virtual machine or the antix2usb script to test the new image, the new setup may not be 100% correct. It may take a few tries #!*!#<br>
<br>
If the changes are not to satisfaction, then...<br>
1. open terminal <br>
2. cd to ~/new-iso or /home/USER/new-iso<br>
3. type su followed by the root password to gain root access<br>
4. start remaster.sh with the -c switch. ( refer to remaster.sh --help for all other switches )<br>
5. make changes at" When done please type"exit" or press CTRL-D" section <br>
6. type exit or press CTRL-D and follow the instructions</div>

<div class="content">Wow. I can't believe it's been almost two months since I started this little project. I got side-tracked for a bit with a request to do a triple-boot system with Windows / Linux / Linux. That was fun. Not very difficult but easily destroyed by a Windows update. <br>
I now have some time for this task; at least until the college crowd gets moving again. I love that there are so many choices and suggestions listed here. I plan to try them all even if I find a solution in the first one. I did manage to clone the systems; and even modify the setups rather quickly. But I would really like to do a Live CD with an install option. <br>
BTW, the ladies think I am a genius developer. I told them I was just the messenger and suggested they consider donating. The only fee I accepted was 20% over cost for some memory chips. <br>

swiftlinuxcreator, thanks for the invite. I am honored. But I need to shake off a few filthy windows habits before I dig deep into this. I make my living fixing Windoze flaws. Is there a name or phrase for old time win developers who cross over? Like born again blah -blah -blah? I mean really born again! I started my career with the new-fangled Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups.</div>

I make my own words up as I go along. I am known as a Linux Friganeer on some Forums.<br>
