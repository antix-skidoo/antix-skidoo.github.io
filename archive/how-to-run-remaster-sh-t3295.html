<div class="content">I have written up a how to for remaster.sh, there is a pdf copy as well as what is written below.<br>

PDF COPY<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.daveserver.info/antiX/remaster-guide.pdf"<br>linktext was:"remaster-guide.pdf"<br>====================================<br>

Quick Guide to using remaster.sh<br>
<br>
Before using remaster.sh, you will need to know how to install applications from the command line. It is also very beneficial to know the basic bash commands for document management. Terminal applications such as mc and nano work with remaster.sh, however not all the applications work.<br>
<br>
How to start with remaster.sh<br>
- open terminal by:<br>
menu --&gt; terminal <br>
or <br>
menu --&gt; run <br>
type: roxterm<br>
press: ok<br>
<br>
- the terminal should open in your user directory, verify this by <br>
type: pwd<br>
press: enter / return <br>
<br>
- output should be similar to this template <br>
/home/USERNAME<br>
<br>
- if pwd does not show an output similar to the above template, procede with the following<br>
type: cd $HOME<br>
press: enter / return<br>
<br>
- verify this once again with pwd. Once you are in the correct directory make a new remaster directory for organization. This is done by:<br>
type: mkdir my-remaster<br>
press: enter / return<br>
<br>
- Now change to your remaster directory, become root user and run remaster.sh<br>
type: cd my-remaster<br>
press: enter / return<br>
type: su<br>
press: enter / return<br>
type: YOUR ROOT PASSWORD ( Established durring the install )<br>
press: enter / return<br>
type: remaster.sh<br>
press: enter / return<br>
<br>
- Now you have run remaster.sh, point it to the correct .iso, I preffer to use a iso downloaded to the hard disk.<br>
type: /home/USERNAME/PATH-TO-ISO<br>
press: enter / return<br>
<br>
- You are now in the remaster console. You can now add packages, edit configurations, and add your own twists to the antiX iso. Here are several notes that will help you with your remaster.<br>
<br>
1. If you need any internet connectivity it should be made through ethernet, I am not sure if all wirelesses do not work, but mine does not.<br>
2. you will need to add packages via apt or manually through dpkg.<br>
3. global configuration files are normally found in /etc/PACKAGE<br>
4. user configuration files (those found in /home/USERNAME/) are to be placed in /etc/skel<br>
5. application templates, default configs / settings are found in /usr/share/<br>
6. desktop / menu shortcuts are found in /usr/share/applications<br>
7. local scripts ( such as remaster.sh ) are found in /usr/local/bin<br>
8. For space saving locals / some documentation can be removed, do not remove documentation that will be helpful to the end user.<br>
9. there are a few scripts that run to setup antix live, boot cheat codes, slim login settings, etc... Be aware of these files, some are in /etc/init.d for loading on startup and some in /usr/share/antiX. These scripts can be edited but be carefull as them will effect the way your live cd works drastically<br>
10. A convenient way I think to set the user prefferances in the gui, is to build a machine from a fresh install, configure it the way you like, then copy the configuration files from /home/USERNAME to /etc/skel of your remaster. To open both these using thunar, you would<br>
11. remember to run apt-get clean to remove all the packages that were downloaded, this is a large space hog if not done.<br>
<br>
menu --&gt; run<br>
type: thunar /home/USERNAME<br>
press: enter / return<br>
menu --&gt; run <br>
type: thunar /home/USERNAME/my-remaster/remaster/new-squashfs/etc/skel<br>
press: enter / return<br>
<br>
You can then copy and edit your user config files through the graphical user interface, rather than learning how to edit every different configuration file so it will work.<br>
<br>
- Once you are done remastering your iso or even if you would like to take a break, press CTRL + D. The next questions will be talked through here, so you can answer them accordingly<br>
1. Do you want to remove"/root/.bash_history","/root/.synaptic/log/","/var/lib/apt/lists/*" (Y/n)?<br>
- this would be your remembered commands, installation log, and apt package lists, answer y and press enter /return if you want them removed. <br>
2. Are you ready to start building the ISO (Y/n)? <br>
- This would be y if you would like to make a cd image of your remaster, n if you are planning on working on it later. Press enter / return after answered. If n is answered then the script will closed till later, when you are ready to work on it again.<br>
open terminal<br>
type: cd /home/USERNAME/my-remaster<br>
press: enter / return<br>
type: remaster.sh -c<br>
press: enter / return<br>
Now you are in the remaster console once again, finish up your iso and follow the rest of the instructions.<br>
<br>
3. Would you like to amend your version file (y/N)? <br>
- If you would like to edit the name of your version then answer y, if not n. Press enter / return when answered.<br>
If y, when the editor opens<br>
edit the file<br>
press: CTRL + X ( when done )<br>
press: y<br>
press: enter / return<br>
4. The ISO file will be placed by default in"/home/USERNAME/my-remaster/remaster" directory. Is that OK (Y/n)?<br>
- pretty self expainatory, but if answered n you will need to enter a path. EG: /home/USERNAME/my-remaster and press enter / return.<br>
5. Enter the name of the ISO file (default: remastered.iso) <br>
- this will be the name of the .iso file for antix M11 full it is antiX-M11-686.iso. This can be changed later by renaming if a mistake is made. Simply type the name you would like EG: my-remaster-1.iso and press enter / return.<br>
<br>
That is it, you should now have a remastered copy of antiX!!!</div>
