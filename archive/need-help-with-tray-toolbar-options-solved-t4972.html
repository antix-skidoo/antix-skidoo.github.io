<div class="content">I would like to have 2 Browser options on my panel. I would like to add an icon and program option for a"Lite" browser. Basically I need to find one that is very efficient on memory needed per tab. I will use the main browser option with chromium for when I need a fully featured, heavy duty browser that does things like watching youtube in slow motion.<br>
<br>
Where can I change my default browser to chromium or whatever? In both toolbar and tray its hard coded as iceweasel, but I'm guessing there could likely be something in the update menu system that generated that there.<br>
<br>
So, how can I do it in a"kosher" manner so that as new programs are added that I can use the update menu function to add items added? I found what look like the source to menus in the console, but not sure the effects of going into them and adding or changing text. I am also unclear the difference between the"tray" and the"toolbar". It looks to me like its the"tray" I should be changing, or whatever controls how its generated, but not sure if the"toolbar" will be popping up someplace else on me.<br>
<br>
Any good way to do this?<br>
<br>
What would be a good browser to choose for the"Lite" one. I am really short on memory and cpu horses, so I need to avoid things that will eat them up on me.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help or suggestions or links.</div>

<div class="content">Look in Meta package installer for browsers. Netsurf and Midori are pretty lite.<br>
<br>
I use Control Center and Edit Icewm or Edit Fluxbox for Tool bar tweaks like <br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://i41.tinypic.com/2h30yly.jpg"<br>linktext was:"http://i41.tinypic.com/2h30yly.jpg"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Where in the above shot I edited ~/.fluxbox/startup for the battery monitor and redshift to show in fluxbox slit.<br>
<br>
In Icewm in ~/.icewm/toolbar which can be accessed through control center.<br>
In the below screenshot I show how I added a browser icon next to default browser icon and then a kicker arrow point up that if you hit it shows a menu for extra stuff added to the toolbar.<br>

this-is-my-final-setup-for-antix-8-5-on-my-asus-eeepc-900-t2391.html<br>
<br>
I guess when I feel better after this flu bout. I could make a Icewm and Fluxbox edit how to.<br>
I get icons and executables using like<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>locate chromium</code></pre></div>
after first doing in root terminal <br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>updatedb</code></pre></div>
after a package install. It gives me launcher and icon paths for including in a Menu or toolbar or startup edit.<br>

I have pretty much tweaked AntiX to look any way I want in 1 day. <br>

Like I say. Locate command is your friend. AntiXCC is your friend. Just take your time and maybe it will click in your mind.<br>

<div class="content">In my experience, end-users who have predominately, (or exclusively) used Windows, initially find antiX most comfortable to use via either JWM or IceWM. Both adopt a layout similar to the classic menu system of Windows. If desired the use of themes (skins) and icon sets can produce a desktop that very closely mimics one that an end-user is familiar with. <br>
<br>
For the above reasons my comments do not refer to Fluxbox. This in no way disparages it.<br>
<br>
In antiX-13.2, the default Window Manager (WM) is IceWM. Although you have not mentioned it, I have made a working assumption this is what you are using.<br>
<br>
A lot of work has recently been done (and continues) to improve the look of the WM menus and general user friendliness. One of these recently introduced IceWM Control Center. It is accessed via Main Menu--&gt;Applications--&gt;System Tools--&gt;IceWMcc. It provides a limited amount of customisation via an interactive GUI. Beyond this, changes are presently made by editing the appropriate configuration files.<br>
<br>
Configuration files are stored in a hidden folder within your home directory i.e. /home/USERNAME/.icewm/... These files can be edited via the antiX Control Center, Main Menu--&gt;Control Center--&gt;Desktop Tab--&gt;Edit IceWM Settings. The usual caveats apply, create a fallback position by making a copy of any file to be edited.<br>
<br>
After changing a configuration it is usually a good idea to restart the WM, Main Menu--&gt;Logout--&gt;Arrowhead--&gt;Restart IceWM. Alternatively logout out and back in again is sometimes preferable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>thriftee wrote:</cite>I am also unclear the difference between the"tray" and the"toolbar".</div></blockquote>These tend to have different meanings in different WMs.<br>
<br>
In IceWM, toolbar and tray are broadly equivalent to taskbar and system-tray respectively in Windows terminology. However, in JWM tray is the equivalent of taskbar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>thriftee wrote:</cite>So, how can I do it in a"kosher" manner so that as new programs are added that I can use the update menu function to add items added?</div></blockquote>One way is to use the metapackage-installer referred to by <strong>rokytnji</strong> in the earlier post. An alternative way to add/remove programs is to use Synaptic Package Manager. Both are found in Main Menu--&gt;Applications--&gt;Preferences.<br>
<br>
Currently, antiX does not have a means of automatically updating its menu after an app has been installed. It needs to be initiated manually via Main Menu--&gt;Update Menu. It is done only once and only for the current session. The newly added app is included automatically during the log-in process.<br>
<br>
To add the new app as a button to the IceWM toolbar presently requires a manual edit.
<ul>
<li>Via the antiX Contol Center select the IceWM toolbar tab.</li>
<li>Each item listed is displayed as a button in the toolbar.</li>
<li>Any line that begins with one or more hashes (#) is regarded as a comment and ignored.</li>
<li>You can comment or uncomment any line without adversely affecting your system.</li></ul>
Taking the entry"Control Center" as an example, the structure of an entry is:
<ul>
<li>prog=indicates a command is to be run</li>
<li>"Control Center"=text to display when the cursor is hovered over the toolbar button</li>
<li>/usr/...preferences-desktop.png=the full path to the icon to display on the button</li>
<li>antixcc.sh=the name of the executable file</li></ul>
One way to find the entries for the icon and executable is:
<ul>
<li>Open a text editor such as leafpad</li>
<li>Open the file from which the Main Menu entry is created for each app<br>
e.g. /usr/share/applications/dillo.desktop</li>
<li>The line that begins Exec= specifies the exectable name, in this case dillo</li>
<li>The line that begins Icon= specifies the icon name in this case dillo</li>
<li>The path to the dillo icon is /usr/share/pixmaps/dillo.png</li></ul></div>

<div class="content">Learning, learning, learning...<br>
<br>
I read your comments. I got midori and netsurf installed, and am testing them now to try to figure out which has the smallest memory footprint per tab. The winner there is definitely netsurf at about 11 mb per tab.<br>
<br>
I admit over the decades, I have become accustomed to Windows style, if you will, be it good or bad. I can do without Windows's"run it from an icon" mentality, as long as I have some way to easily get it on a menu so its easy to find and run when I need it. I'm sure I can edit these menus. I guess I'll try making a simple change and see if update menu overwrites it.<br>
<br>
I found a program called lxtask. I like that one. Its just what the Dr. ordered for a memory strapped and cpu bound machine. In the interest of minimizing resource usage I turned off Rox. That volume icon needs to go, too, for 10 mb I can have a menu option to run alsamixer or some other mixer program when needed. Conky needs to go as well because of the load its going to put on the cpu. If I could run it from a menu when I want to, and close it when I'm done, that will be fine.<br>
<br>
I went thru all the Desktops/Windows in antiX last night and would say that based on based on what I saw there, IceWM seems the most appealing to me. It seems pretty efficient and looks nice.<br>
<br>
The most common file related task I do day to day is moving files to or from flash drives, and I didn't find any way to do that easily with any of the linux file manager programs. All of the ones I've seen except Debian Jessie XFCE (and maybe Manjaro, I forget), require creating directories and mounting things, which has always seemed foreign to me. There is no way I can remember a 30 character UUID, lol, and it would be much easier if the app could just pick a sensible name for me based on the device type. My preference would be an application I could bring up that would show the drives and volumes available, and if I click on one that needs to be mounted, offer to do it for me and drill down into it. It doesn't need to be running on the desktop all the time, and it would be great if I could just call it from the menu when I want it. I read good things about a program called PCManFM, and I installed it, and ran the update menu, but it doesn't appear anyplace that I found, yet. Any suggestions for a file manager that I can run when needed that will mount up other drives if/when I ask it to?<br>
<br>
I guess I need to experiment. As far as conky goes, can I just run that from a menu if I want to and close it when done?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the hints, suggestions and ideas. You were both quite helpful.</div>

<div class="content">filemanager- you need to try spacefm, its installed by default in Tools&gt;Filers I do believe. Originally based on pcmanfm, its its own beast these days. I use it for all my mounting needs. I've got a video series on the antix Filemanagers (rox and spacefm) on my youtube channel.<br>
<br>
running conky on demand is fine. There is a conky on/off toggle in the Desktop menu.<br>
<br>
The only menu file that gets overwriten when"update menu" runs is the"Applications" submenu. Its a pointer to a separate file. Keep your customization in the main menu or your own submenus, but don't put them in the Applications submenu. Just about any app installed from synaptic or the metapackage-installer will show up in Applications automatically once Update menu is run, but its more hit and miss with apps installed straight from the internet or compiled from source (true for any desktop environment when you go outside the standard package management system). I have several custom menu entries in the top level of my menu, but you could make your own sub-menu just as easy. icewm's menu file syntax is pretty easy. Just stare at it for a bit and I think you'll get the idea.<br>
<br>
I can't believe I haven't done a video on custom menu and taskbar entries! So I've got some work to do on the channel!</div>

<div class="content">Ahhhh, thanks for the answer on menu customization. <br>
<br>
And I figured out the flashdrive. I just found out that pcmanfm will actually do fine as long as you insert it while the program is running. But yes, your spacefm did a nice job with it. I think I like its functionality better. LOL, EITHER is way better than trying to mount things manually. ArgH!, I spent 30 min trying to mount it to copy a desktop wallpaper image last night, and every set of instructions was different, LOL.<br>
<br>
Spacefm seems better, but I can't seem to get it so I can read the menu at the top because the color scheme is so bad. I had to put glasses on and get my face right up to it to be able to see at all. Is it something I did wrong? I tried changing colors, but it only helped a tiny bit. Ahhh, I figured it out. Its because I was using su because I have so much trouble seeing or doing things if not. Ahhh, and when I go back to being a regular user, the flashdrive disappears! I guess that explains why none of these programs see the flash drive. I guess I need to be su'd to do anything like that.<br>
<br>
As for conky, I really don't want to be turning it on/off. I just want to pop up a window with the info on demand and close it again when done so its not sitting there running in background. I may try changing it to a longer interval. I've only got a 733 mhz cpu, so I can't be wasting what little horsepower I have.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the ideas, though.</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>thriftee wrote:</cite>I can do without Windows's"run it from an icon" mentality...</div></blockquote>If you select space-icewm at log in, the session will default to using IceWM as your WM and SpaceFM to manage your desktop. The latest version of SpaceFM used in antiX is able to hold shortcut icons on your desktop in a similar manner to Windows.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>thriftee wrote:</cite>I found a program called lxtask.</div></blockquote>If you are looking for something to help you to gauge the amount system resources used by an app, antiX includes a well regarded one named, Htop. It is started by Main Menu--&gt;Tools--&gt;System--&gt;Process Viewer. I have not used lxtask for a few years, perhaps Htop might use fewer resources to provide you with the info.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>thriftee wrote:</cite>In the interest of minimizing resource usage I turned off Rox.</div></blockquote>I assume you are referring to ROX-Pinboard. This step will no longer be needed if you start the session using space-icewm.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>thriftee wrote:</cite>That volume icon needs to go...<br>
Conky needs to go as well...</div></blockquote>To prevent them being loaded automatically at log-in, use antiX Control Center (IceWM Startup tab) and comment out (#) the relevant entries.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>thriftee wrote:</cite>...mounting things, which has always seemed foreign to me.</div></blockquote>Just a note for the future in case you install antiX again (potentially when you have finished experimenting). At the CD or USB boot screen select F4 Automount and F6 Space-IceWM and these will be used to start the live session and also carry accross to any resulting installation.</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>triftee wrote:</cite>I've only got a 733 mhz cpu, so I can't be wasting what little horsepower I have.</div></blockquote>With kit that is very low powered using ROX-Filer often provides a snapier response time than SpaceFM. The difference is not noticeable on newer high powered kit but becomes increasingly noticeable as the power of the kit lessens.<br>
<br>
ROX-Filer does not require ROX-Pinboard, and can be setup to automount flash drives upon plugging-in or on demand, to suit your preference.<br>

The most common file related task I do day to day is moving files to or from flash drives, and I didn't find any way to do that easily with any of the linux file manager programs. All of the ones I've seen except Debian Jessie XFCE (and maybe Manjaro, I forget), require creating directories and mounting things, which has always seemed foreign to me. There is no way I can remember a 30 character UUID, lol, and it would be much easier if the app could just pick a sensible name for me based on the device type. My preference would be an application I could bring up that would show the drives and volumes available, and if I click on one that needs to be mounted, offer to do it for me and drill down into it. It doesn't need to be running on the desktop all the time, and it would be great if I could just call it from the menu when I want it. I read good things about a program called PCManFM, and I installed it, and ran the update menu, but it doesn't appear anyplace that I found, yet. Any suggestions for a file manager that I can run when needed that will mount up other drives if/when I ask it to?<br>
</div></blockquote>
If you go to run on the menu and type in"mountbox" your flash/usb will be there (usually called sdb i think. mount it and rox will open so you can do what you need to. i usaully open another instance of rox so i can move stuf to and from the flash drive.</div>

That was the program I was using before, though not run from the command line. I always get a"Mount failed" error, and it references a special device UUID=16A8-A122 does not exist<br>
<br>
I then tried mounting in xterm etc and had problems with format type, which I didn't understand why, and eventually I reformatted it as FAT not FAT32 under windows and reloaded the data, and eventually got the files to copy, but it having taken so long and so many tries, I forgot how I got it to work.<br>
<br>
I will go read up on Sam's suggestion. Honestly, it isn't even important for things to mount automatically as long as they actually work.<br>
<br>
Maybe this is ALL a root authority problem? <br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for the suggestion<br>
<br>
<br>
I got conky reconfigured, mostly. Still trying to get my weather and forecast onto it, but might trim that down to just current and todays forecast, but need to cut it out of a bunch of text, or find a better source than weather-util. I didn't get it running as a separate program, and maybe it can't, in which case maybe I have to do the turning off/on thing suggested above or really stretch the intervals.<br>
<br>
I'm down to using 45 mb of ram with no apps running, and not getting into swap until I get a bunch of things running, so I'm doing pretty well, there.<br>
<br>
Haven't attempted menus yet, but will try it tonight<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the ideas/suggestions etc<br>
<br>
PS: Got the flashdrive working using spacefm by just changing the menu and panel options to call it. Its only using 1 mb of memory to run a spacefm window, so that's fine now.<br>
PSS: Tried making some minor menu changes, and removed the volume control, added alsamixer and htop to the main menu</div>

<div class="content">Well, I got everything working at least somewhat. Not expecting perfection, just need it to be functional. <br>
<br>
For a"junker" laptop, its really looking pretty good and running quite well. You'd never guess it was a 14 yr old 733 mhz machine if you were sitting there working on it. With conky running its using only 53 mb of memory. Not too shabby. And today, my $7 memory chips arrrived, so it should have 512 mb in it later tonight.<br>
<br>
The only other thing I need to do is increase the size of the conky box, which I didn't see anywhere and I need to see if I can find a faster way to get the weather forecast than from the NWS via weather command, because its taking 20 or 30 seconds. Any ideas on that?<br>
<br>
PS: I found a package called conkywx that does weather, and will give it a try. That will avoid the problems with the window size and the NWS.</div>

Its getting very confusing trying to follow whats happening because lots of topics are being addressed in this thread. It is much easier for others to follow single issue topics. Are you able to divide out the multiple issues into separate threads?</div>

<div class="content">Sam,<br>
<br>
I closed the thread as the last of the issues with the tray/toolbar are resolved. I admit it got jumbled, but a lot of that was because what I wanted to do with the tray and toolbar was better done (as suggested) by tweaking conky and making it quick/easy to get the needed functionality by turning conky on/off to conserve resources, and adding the detailed functions to the main menu once I knew it wouldn't be overwritten.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to all for the great ideas. I'd have been spinning my wheels forever without them.</div>
