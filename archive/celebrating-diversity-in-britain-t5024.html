<div class="content">You'll find this kinda funny Alanarchy.<br>
<br>
I live in the desert. But. All the Muslims live up north in the U.S.<br>
I only had 2 biker buddies from Iran when I lived in El Paso.<br>
They were well heeled bikers with fat wallets.<br>
Fun to hang out with.<br>
Religion never came up.<br>
<br>
Muslims seem as rare as hens teeth down here in my desert.<br>
<br>
Edit: Forgot the other funny thing about my buddies.<br>
They look Hispanic. So my Hispanic buds would speak Spanish thinking they were Hispanic.<br>
I loved the looks on their faces when they replied in Farsi. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this Alanarchy. I despair of what's happening in the world today - this <br>
Nigerian thing, it's like"Heart of Darkness".<br>
<br>
- Only man is vile<br>
- A plague on all your houses<br>
<br>
Here are two stories:<br>
<br>
Story 1:<br>
In the early '80s I worked for the academic imprint of Macmillan (the UK <br>
publishing house - not to be confused with the American publishing house of the <br>
same name, which was - at that time - owned by Robert Maxwell). Gorbachov was <br>
in power. The end of the 'iron curtain' was in sight.<br>
<br>
A friend of mine, who was the senior editor for the Politics list, lunched with <br>
one of his important authors (Professor"Blob" of Birmingham University (let's <br>
say)). Over lunch they discussed the future of international politics.<br>
<br>
"So" said my friend"it looks as if the iron curtain's coming down" (and this, <br>
don't forget, had been top of everyone's agenda from 1945)"what's the next <br>
area we should be considering?"<br>
<br>
"I believe" said Blob"that we will return to the Middle Ages and fight <br>
religious wars."<br>
<br>
Story 2:<br>
In 1969 I joined the publisher William Collins (Now Harper-Collins &amp; owned by <br>
Rupert Murdoch). Subsequent to the"Battle of the Bogside" that August, British <br>
troops had been deployed to Northern Ireland (NI), to defend the Catholics, and <br>
were, initially, welcomed.<br>
<br>
In (I suppose, September) I was taken to the Ministy of Defence (MoD) to visit <br>
the book buyer for the NAAFI (Navy, Army, Air Force Institutes - the equivalent <br>
of the BX or PX in the US) and during our talk he said:<br>
<br>
"I probably shouldn't tell you this but we" (the NAAFI)"have been told <br>
to make provision for the troops being in NI for the next 20 years."<br>
<br>
Great God, we'd expected our boys back by 5th November (which we Brits <br>
traditionally celebrate by burning a Catholic (Guy Fawkes) in effigy). That was <br>
45 years ago - seen the news lately?<br>
<br>
I only hope that in 100 years or so something good comes of all this.<br>

<div class="content">@jdmeaux - I wholly agree, but the problem is that all these beliefs (whether Christianity, Mohammedanism or Mormonism) are based on writinngs supposedly handed down by"supernatural beings".<br>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>jdmeaux1952 wrote:</cite>It is not the"supernatural beings" that are the problem. The problem are with the people who wish to pollute what they believe, and force others to believe it too.</div></blockquote>
I would respectfully disagree about"pollution". Both the bible and Quran contain passages that explicitly condone barbaric behavior; these text were written by and for control of ignorant people thousands of years ago yet many insist they should continue to be the manuals to guide ones life. when men wish to control other men the fall back to divine guidance is a common one. Want to justify your own sick desires? start a religion where"GOD" condones them. We demand empirical evidence for scientific beliefs yet we give a free pass to religion. I am fine with people believing in something; when they inflict the restrictions of their beliefs on others I have a problem. when we blithely say"oh it's their culture" and condemn children, especially women, to mis-treatment I find it cowardly. the biggest problem I have with the major religions is that they inherently demand that their followers spread them like a virus, either by preaching or by way of violence. IMHO all such religions are scams, means to control people and gather income like an MLM pyramid scheme with an invisible and unverifiable product called eternity. What we know we have is here and now; to agonize over some supposed afterlife rather than make the best of what we have here is ignorant. My eternity lies in the echoes of my life. The memories I leave with those I love and hopefully the positive impact I may have in others lives. Do as little harm as possible, let those you love know it and help those who you can if you see fit to do so. To live your life under the dictates of a supposed higher beings version of moral action is no morality at all; it is action based on fear of the loss of some illusory prize offered by said being.</div>
