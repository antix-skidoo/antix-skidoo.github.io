<div class="content">i want to say first that i am very satisfied with the state and functionality of linux in general and antix in particular<br>
it is my os of choice, and @anticapitalista, you are doing a great job<br>
of course its not perfect, but its simply amazing to me<br>
<br>
i see no reason to use any other os, and i have used windows for more than 10 years, and a couple of linux distros<br>
i dont really understand why people use windows except out of habit<br>
if not for the latest games i see no other reason to use windows<br>
i have win xp dualboot, but i rarely use it (once per month), when finding something i cant do, like working with specific file types or devices<br>
but after using alternatives, from working with android (including flashing samsung roms with heimdall) and some printers<br>
i cant see the killer app (area/domain) of windows, sure there are exceptions, but i didnt found some windows-only need, for like 90% of user tasks<br>
<br>
linux is so well thought out, from top to bottom<br>
modular, and rock solid architecture<br>
this explains it better back in 2004 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/22/security_report_windows_vs_linux/#multiuser"<br>linktext was:"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/22 ... #multiuser"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
and i still think it applies<br>
<br>
i would like to know if any of you are using windows or other os/distro, and the reasons why</div>

<div class="content">ChromeOS on a Chrome Book. Why? Cost less than 100 bucks for me. Impulse buy with spare beer money.<br>
Slackel Fluxbox 14.1 on a Netbook. Why? To teach me Slackware. Plus learn Sorcerery and Slaptget. <br>
Various Puppy Linux flavors. Why? To teach me Puppy. How .pets and .sfs and grub4dos mutiboot works.<br>
Slitaz Linux. Why? Because I need to learn something. Still learning.<br>
GhostBSD. Why? To find out how dumb I am. I am spinning my wheels running it, getting pretty much nowhere.<br>
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS minimal iso&gt;Icewm/Xfce. Why? Because I needed a Windows like box for certain people to play with. Plus learn how a Ubuntu minimal install procedure works.<br>
<br>
Not counting My motorcycle shop MX-14, AntiX 15, Windows XP (not online but lots of games), Boxes for Media centers and playtoys for customers.<br>
Plus testing laptops for when we decide to migrate forward with the times. Having savage and sis graphics chips hardware on my gear<br>
makes it so it is easier for us to help others. <br>

I never limit myself to one mindset or train of thought. <span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF0040">But</span></span>.

<div class="content">Hello, All!<br>
<br>
Like rokytnji, I have a number of different machines, that serve a wide variety of purposes. Therefore, I use Windows, and several flavors of Linux. I only use Windows when absolutely necessary - basically, to record TV, and to program radios. The radio programming software won't work by using wine or in a VM, and it just isn't available for Linux. Also, there just isn't a Linux equivalent for Media Center, even if you try 'assembling the pieces' under Linux.<br>
<br>
1. Linux Lite 2.6, because It's easily customized, works reasonably well on a wide variety of machines, and I believe in what Jerry Bezencon is doing with Linux Lite.<br>
<br>
2. Peppermint 6. I have an old netbook that runs too slowly on either Linux Lite or Lubuntu - even with it using an SSD and 2 GB RAM. If it's going to be sluggish, why bother? <br>
<br>
3. AntiX, because it seems to work better for 'portable' flash drive installs than everything else. Were it not for rokytnji mentioning it in the LL forums, I probably wouldn't have ever tried AntiX. AntiX seems to be relatively easy for folks to understand and use - considerably more so than Puppy, which I had tried using before AntiX. This is important because I intend for people I know to use this to preserve their privacy when they use PCs at libraries, colleges, and other public places.<br>
<br>
Here, AntiX has turned an ancient, essentially useless laptop (P3-1066, 512MB RAM) into a 'holiday jukebox' that played Pandora with Pithos for a month straight. (Needless to say, after a month of continuous Christmas music, we were all thoroughly insane!). Now that I've learned a thing or two about AntiX, I don't think I'd use anything else to create a portable system with...<br>
