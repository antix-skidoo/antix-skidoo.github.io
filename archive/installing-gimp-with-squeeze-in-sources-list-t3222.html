<div class="content">Hello All<br>
<br>
I've installed AntiX on a spare partition, and I have enabled the Squeeze repositories in sources.list and commented out the testing.<br>
<br>
When trying to install GIMP, I get the following...<br>

<div class="content">First off the simple solution, did you do an apt-get update? If you have then I have found for issues like this you can<br>
1. wait for the rest of the packages to be updated <br>
2. download the older version of the package, install and continue with the rest of the installation. In this case libgimp2.0 version 2.6.10-z needs to be installed<br>
3. change your sources.list to testing again, install gimp, then change back to stable. ( I believe this is the same as waiting, just slightly before it is listed as a stable package. )<br>

I prefer the 3rd method because it is the easier way or resolving the issue, and it is ready to use when you need it</div>

Hello Dave and thanks for replying<br>
<br>
I went down the number 2 route<br>
<br>
I uninstalled the current version of libgimp2.0 using<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>apt-get remove libgimp2.0</code></pre></div>
then I updated and upgraded and then installed gimp using<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>apt-get install gimp</code></pre></div>
and finally remembered to do Menu | Desktop | IceWM | Update Menu<br>
<br>
All fine now, I'm assuming that the newer packages will appear in Squeeze as and when they need to</div>

Well: no. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
Debian stable (repositories) does not get any updates of packages, only security updates. See here:<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-choosing.en.html#s3.1.9"<br>linktext was:"http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debia ... tml#s3.1.9"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
That means you would have to wait until a new release of Debian, which might be quite long (and during that time a new release of antiX will be out, and you got the same problem again).<br>
<br>
How one should/could start with testing and then go to stable is beyond me. The antiX /etc/apt/sources.list seems to make that possible, and i work around it by removing the stable repository and upgrading to testing (or sid) immediatly after installation. Never tried it the other way around. The testing packages will have a higher version number (often), and if i remove the testing repo it means they won't get updates anymore. Hence i don't do it.<br>
<br>
If you run something like stable you can't simply add repos and then remove them. Either user backports (
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://backports-master.debian.org/"<br>linktext was:"debian"<br>====================================<br>
 or 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.mepiscommunity.org/node/842"<br>linktext was:"mepis-community"<br>====================================<br>
, for example), or backport the packages yourself. 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php?title=Backport"<br>linktext was:"http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php?title=Backport"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not that sure how it is in antiX, so it might well be wrong ( i can't think of a reason why it should be, but would not bet on it. There must be a reason why the stable repos are activated).</div>

Hello nadir<br>
<br>
Thanks, that's cool, as long as I have a functioning GIMP and no clashes when updating, it'll do.<br>
<br>
Any and All<br>
<br>
If I wanted a 'stable' AntiX, should I have changed the sources.list to point at squeeze before the first update just after installing?</div>

 <div class="content">Thank you nadir,<br>
<br>
You are more correct here, It has never occurred to me that packages are not updated in stable till an official release. I would agree that the error is due to the package trying to install a older version when there is a newer version already. As antix is testing by default trying to go back to stable would cause the error. Seeing how packages do not get updated in stable, what would be the proper way of reverting back to stable, through backporting? Would my 2nd suggestion be the more correct way then? As it seems that the first suggestion could take a year, and the third is making a mix of stable and testing ( not truly stable slightly before stable ). I was using the 3rd way for 1 of my computers, under the understanding that they will be updated soon anyway.</div>

<div class="content">I wanted to ask this, how can one run antiX with stable repos, for a long time, but always forgot to do so.<br>
I got one main machine, and a lot of test machines (reall and VBox). For those a stable system is better, as i don't run into so much updates if i didn't boot it for a while.<br>
on another note: People start to ask me about linux, and to install it for them (thanks Win7 <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> ) I am not sure if i want to offer them Debian(-pure). All of them like antiX, but i would not want them to have to upgrade regulary. Else antiX would be my clear choice (as it has got so much gui-configuration tools +a lot of applications needed. Those people also try it on elder hardware, so a wm is a good choice)<br>
<br>
Did someone do it, and if yes: how?<br>

<div class="content">My main Antix system, where I do all of my work, is a laptop running antix 8.2 stable. It has been running stable now for quite a while. In order to get it there, first you need to edit /apt/sources/list and remark out all the testing repositories. Then do:<br>
<br>
apt-get update<br>
apt-get upgrade<br>
<br>
You will have to periodically do the update/upgrade, even if running stable as it will fix any security problems. So"stable" does not mean"no changes" it just means"less likely to break due to recent changes == Testing".<br>
<br>
I hope this helps.<br>

<div class="content">Thank you Pedro,<br>
Now for clarification on this information, there are a few points inline with the topic that I would like to have verified.<br>
To change to stable, <br>
1. change /etc/apt/sources.list from testing repositories to the stable repositories<br>
2. apt-get update --&gt; apt-get upgrade<br>
3. Periodic apt-get update --&gt; apt-get upgrade for security problems<br>
<br>
Now, antiX by default is testing, so by default the applications are upgraded to testing as per the release date.<br>
1. When installing applications such as gimp from the stable repositories, the stable packages you are trying to install will request the older (stable) package version as a dependency. However there may be newer packages installed already, as antiX is testing by default. So you would need to apt-get remove ( to remove the testing version ) then apt-get install the package from the stable repository to solve the dependency issue and remain stable.<br>
<br>
Now this will work and keep you closer to a true stable system, but there will still remain a few packages in testing version. In which case you will still have a mix of a stable and testing system. This would mean for a truly stable system starting with M11 you would need to remove all the testing packages and reinstall them from the stable repositories or update and wait for the current testing to become stable ( running a testing / stable mix till then ). <br>
<br>
2. Now if the aim is for a true stable system, with all stable packages versions, would it then be more suitable to install an antiX version that was released before the release of the latest stable system ( M8.5 as it's installed"testing" packages would be the now stable Squeeze ). From here then enable the stable repositories and do an apt-get update --&gt; apt-get upgrade. Based on my experience, there is a high probability of failure when trying to accomplish this way of having a truly stable system. <br>
<br>
If my thoughts in the first point are correct in these 2 points, then those expressed in the first would be the only working way of having a truly stable antiX system. Which seems to be what Pedro has done by starting to change to stable in M8.2 then becoming truly stable when squeeze went stable.</div>
