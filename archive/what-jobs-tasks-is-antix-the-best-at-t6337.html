Comparing antiX to other distros in the same category (not for example against pfSense - one of many distros designed for connection sharing), what jobs/task is it the best at?<br>

<div class="content">Mine works real well in my shop as a stereo center and movie player on a computer that was pulled out of a dumpster.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2YKCLo0.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Besides buying motorcycle parts on ebay and looking up repair sites for projects I am working on.<br>
Windows 10, Ubuntu 14, Mint, any KDE, or high memory/cpu intensive operating system won't do on that emachine that was scheduled for scrap.<br>
<br>
But. It is just one of many of my recycled projects. /usr/local/bin in AntiX is the bomb also and assists me in tasks that no other distro has the capability of doing either. On a old box. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Edit: This thread answered by a non conventional computer user. Who has no interest in using connect shares. A hammer and screwdriver was mentioned.<br>
My computers are like those tools in a tool box. I have a Windows 10 laptop whose only job is to tune motorcycles. It hardly touches the INTERNET.<br>
<br>
I only use Linux on the Internet.</div>

General computing for the most part. I do have a custom antiX built as a streaming music player. The real shine to antiX is that it runs in so little ram and on so little hardware requirements. <br>
<br>
and any scenario where you want to run off a liveUSB stick. The persistence features are outstanding.</div>

<div class="content">Use it as my everyday OS, used to be running Puppy. It is good a distro like Antix still exists to support 32bit hardware when other distros lose the plot and go 64bit only:)</div>

Top features and use cases for antiX, from my perspective:<br>
<br>
1. Works well across a wide range of hardware, so you can use it on newer systems if you want (and it's really fast with the latest equipment), but it scales up and down, and ages very well, working easily on equipment that is five to ten years old, and sometimes older than that.<br>
<br>
2. It's flexible, so if you do not appreciate certain features and you want to replace them, the toolchest provided makes it easy to customize and modify the system to your personal tastes.<br>
<br>
3. For me, antiX works great for Internet-based activities. I can use any installed version, but I can also carry around a modest sized USB stick and run it on any system that can be booted from USB. IF I can write on that system, I can save a"persistent state", so when I return, I can use what I brought with me the previous time, but if not, I can run unobtrusively and not alter the system I may be"borrowing" in any way, except to temporarily access it through USB access, then turn off the system, leaving its contents intact once I'm done borrowing it.<br>
<br>
4. It"scratches whatever itch" I have time to explore. I can try new technology, explore features across different hardware platforms, run the stock applications that it offers, or use one of the tools in the tool chest to create a highly customized environment. This is significant, because there are multiple choices - use a full implementation provided to you, which works as is, create a system from a solid base, which has Internet-capable tools, or a third option to build an entire system out of core technology, virtually from scratch. Few systems offer these choices at all, and none offer the range of choices with a well-engineered base platform. AntiX didn't invent all of the tools and options, but antiX does integrate the best of the best unlike any other distribution.</div>
