<div class="content">I'm now trying to upgrade from M8.5 to M11 (and by upgrade, I mean I'm gonna format my drive and do a fresh install of M11). I actually tried this a couple days ago, but reverted to M8.5 because I couldn't get the wireless working in M11.<br>
<br>
I do Control Center -&gt; Network -&gt; Ceni.<br>
In M8.5, it detects my wireless but not my wired.<br>
In M11, it detects my wired but not my wireless.<br>
<br>
Since I use wireless most of the time, I've been sticking to M8.5. But as I read about how everyone love M11 so much, I really want to upgrade. I'm by no means a linux expert, and less so of an Antix expert. Any help would be great.<br>
<br>
I'm running a Dell Inspiron 1720 laptop.<br>

Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">For some reason the wired isn't working either, so I can't cut and paste the output easily. Here is what I think is the relevant line<br>
<br>
Network: Card-1 Broadcom BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX driver b44 v: 2.0 BusID: 03:00.0<br>
Card-2 Broadcom BCM4321 802.11a/b/g/n driver b43-pci-bridge BusID: 0c:00.0<br>
<br>
Looks to me like both cards are there. If you need the whole output, I can just transfer the whole shebang with a usb stick or something. Thanks.<br>

Here is the same thing but when I'm booted into M8.5 where the wireless is working<br>

<div class="content">Maybe I can completely remove the driver and use ndiswrapper with the windows xp driver? But when I try that, it's still indicating the b43 driver is being used. I guess I'm not sure how to completely remove the b43 driver.<br>

The easy solution here is for me to just go back to M8.5 where everything is working. But then I'd need someone to assure me that M11 is not"that" great compared to M8.5. Then I can go about my life happy and ignorant.</div>

<div class="content">I just tried the livecd on my main laptop running 8.2 and I had the same problem as you. I have the same broadcom card as you. I've been holding back updating this laptop for other reasons and the wireless just adds to it.<br>

I will look around to see if I can find a fix to this and will post a solution if I find it.<br>

Best of luck to you in the meantime.<br>

PS. I remembered that I had to install a kernel module to get this broadcom card to work. Here are some of my posts about it<br>
<br>
can-t-see-usb-sticks-after-squeeze-update-t2967-30.html<br>
<br>
the instructions on how to build the module are here:<br>

<br>
<br>
It does work, it just takes a bit.<br>
<br>
P.P.S. Forgot to mention that I was successful in adding the wl.ko module only in a liquorix or a debian kernel. I could not get the MEPIS kernel to work for this.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for working on this with me. <br>
<br>
I just realized something that might be part of my problem. When I'm in M8.5 the wireless interface is called eth0. Usually in other distros I think it's called wlan0. In M11 the wired connection is called eth0. I'm not sure what all this means, but I'm pretty sure they can't both be eth0. Does this mean anything to anyone? I wish I know more about this stuff.</div>

<div class="content">pacopag,<br>
<br>
What you might try is to boot up your antiX11 and then open wicd,<br>
control center&gt;Network&gt;Wicd<br>
<br>
When you get wicd opened up click on preferences, you should be on General Settings<br>
in the box for Wireless interface put the correct interface for your wireless (eth1, wlan0 or whatever it is) and the correct one for your wired, click ok<br>
and then on the wicd icon in the lower right of the click on which one you want to connect with.<br>
If this is not clear let me know and I'll post some screenshots.<br>

<br>
Might as well try why ohh suggested. It might work and solve your problem.<br>
<br>
If not (as was the case for me in 8.5) then you will have to compile the missing kernel module (wl_hybrid; you do this once) and insert it into the kernel after you boot. It's not a big deal but some assembly is required <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> The instructions in the webpage I listed (from Broadcom) are pretty straightforward, so it's up you whether you want to deal with this or not, but this is likely a fixable problem.<br>

Best of luck.<br>

<div class="content">I'm confused?? Your card id identified differently in the two versions.<br>
<br>
Make sure you have b43-fwcutter installed and also install broadcom-sta-common. I think this should work if your card is a 4321.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Broadcom STA is a binary-only device driver to support the following IEEE<br>
802.11a/b/g/n wireless network cards: BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-,<br>
BCM4321-, BCM4322-, BCM43224-, BCM43225-, BCM43227-, and BCM43228-based<br>
hardware.</div></blockquote>
Also I would blacklist wl in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. This will prevent it from loading on boot. Once done reboot.<br>
<br>
EDIT: You will need to enable the non-free repo if you haven't already.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all! <br>
I've just installed antix M11 on USB key following the TedV-UK procedure:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>TedV-UK wrote:</cite>I have a laptop whose installed system (aptosid) is configured for work-related purposes, so installing over top of that wasn't an option. So I could play with AntiX in parallel, I decided to install it on an external USB HDD. The following are the steps I followed to get it working. <br>
I have tried to make the steps sufficiently detailed so others can follow them. <br>
<br>
Hardware: <br>
Dell Inspiron 6000 (4 years old)<br>
Intel Pentium M 2.0 GHz<br>
2 GB RAM<br>
Wired: Broadcom BCM4401-B0 <br>
Wireless: Intel Pro 2200BG <br>
<br>
External USB HDD: <br>
Western Digital Element 250 GB (USB powered)<br>
25 GB for root<br>
198 GB for /home<br>
10 GB for /swap<br>
<br>
AntiX 686-update Live CD (updated version from 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.mepisimo.com/antix/Testing/"<br>linktext was:"http://www.mepisimo.com/antix/Testing/"<br>====================================<br>
) <br>
Boot cheat codes: I left the"lean" and added lang=en_GB<br>
<br>
Used the AntiX installer (not antix2usb) and did a normal install onto the external hdd. <br>
At this point, the external hdd did not boot properly, nor did it find the wired ethernet connection because the Broadcom kernel module wasn't loaded. <br>
<br>
Post-Installation Tinkering: <br>
The laptop was still running from the Live CD so ...<br>
1. I used Gparted to find the UUIDs for the 3 partitions on the external hdd. <br>
2. I mounted the root partition using the mount utility in the AntiX Control Centre (Disks tab &gt; Mount Connected Devices icon).<br>
3. /boot/grub/menu.lst was edited: <br>
"root (hd1,0)" was changed to"root (hd0,0)" <br>
"kernel ... /dev/sdb1 ..." was changed to"kernel ... /dev/disk/by-uuid/&lt;uuid here&gt; ..." <br>
added rootdelay=8 at the end of the kernel line to allow time for USB devices to settle. <br>
removed"boot" in the final line of the section because it's not needed.<br>
4. /etc/fstab was edited: <br>
"/dev/sdb&lt;n&gt;" was replaced by"UUID=&lt;uuid for partition&gt;" <br>
5. /etc/modprobe.d/b43.conf was edited: <br>
I commented out the line containing"install b44 true" by putting a # at the beginning.<br>
Note that the comments within this file refer to a /etc/defaults/mepis-network file/folder which does not seem to exist in the installed AntiX system. <br>
6. I booted the system from the external USB HDD (after removing the Live CD). For some reason I have to use F12 to manually select the external USB drive even though I have set the BIOS boot order to CD then external USB drive then internal HDD. (My Arch Linux system which is also installed on an external USB HDD doesn't require me to press F12. So there is a bit of a mystery here.) After selecting the external USB drive, AntiX starts perfectly. <br>
7. From the AntiX Control Centre, (Network tab &gt; Configure DSL Connection icon) I started the DSL configuration, replied"No" when it asked if all my interfaces were shown (because the wired ethernet was missing) and under the kernel/drivers/net section I added the b44 kernel module. Note that it said the"installation failed". <br>
8. I rebooted the laptop from the external USB HDD and repeated step 7. This time it said the installation was successful. However the wired ethernet connection still wasn't working nor detected. <br>
9. I rebooted the laptop a third time and the wired ethernet connection was detected and working. I edited the preferences for Wicd to make the wired connection my default (AntiX Control Centre &gt; Network tab &gt; Connect Wirelessly (wicd) icon). <br>
10. I used Ceni to edit my wired connection (AntiX Control Centre &gt; Network tab &gt; Network Interfaces (ceni) icon). For the wired connection I selected"dhcp" and then"auto" (within the class window) because it is a built-in ethernet. <br>
11. I opened a terminal, logged in as root and ran the get-iana script. I left the terminal window open for step 13. <br>
12. I edited the firewall settings (AntiX Control Centre &gt; Network tab &gt; Manage Firewall icon) <br>
START_FIREHOL=NO was changed to START_FIREHOL=YES <br>
I saved the file. <br>
Then I restarted the firewall (Firehol) by clicking on the Restart icon and typed in my root password when it asked.<br>
13. In the open root terminal window I updated my system: <br>
apt-get update <br>
apt-get dist-upgrade <br>
apt-get -f install <br>
apt-get clean <br>
apt-get autoclean<br>
I closed the terminal window. <br>
14. I have a running and up-to-date AntiX system on my external USB HDD. <br>
<br>
I hope this is helpful.<br>
<br>
Kind Regards,<br>

I followed fine the steps from 1 to 4, but I could'n make the step 5, since b43.conf isn't in my USB key.<br>
I'm not so expert, but reading the other steps I believe the b43.conf is related to wireless network. As matter of fact, actually I can boot AntiX from my USB key, but running Wicd or Ceni it's seems it doesn't recognize my wireless card.<br>
Running inx -F I have:<br>

I've just installed antix M11 on USB key following the TedV-UK procedure:<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>TedV-UK wrote:</cite>I have a laptop whose installed system (aptosid) is configured for work-related purposes, so installing over top of that wasn't an option. So I could play with AntiX in parallel, I decided to install it on an external USB HDD. The following are the steps I followed to get it working. <br>
I have tried to make the steps sufficiently detailed so others can follow them. <br>
<br>
Hardware: <br>
Dell Inspiron 6000 (4 years old)<br>
Intel Pentium M 2.0 GHz<br>
2 GB RAM<br>
Wired: Broadcom BCM4401-B0 <br>
Wireless: Intel Pro 2200BG <br>
<br>
External USB HDD: <br>
Western Digital Element 250 GB (USB powered)<br>
25 GB for root<br>
198 GB for /home<br>
10 GB for /swap<br>
<br>
AntiX 686-update Live CD (updated version from 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.mepisimo.com/antix/Testing/"<br>linktext was:"http://www.mepisimo.com/antix/Testing/"<br>====================================<br>
) <br>
Boot cheat codes: I left the"lean" and added lang=en_GB<br>
<br>
Used the AntiX installer (not antix2usb) and did a normal install onto the external hdd. <br>
At this point, the external hdd did not boot properly, nor did it find the wired ethernet connection because the Broadcom kernel module wasn't loaded. <br>
<br>
Post-Installation Tinkering: <br>
The laptop was still running from the Live CD so ...<br>
1. I used Gparted to find the UUIDs for the 3 partitions on the external hdd. <br>
2. I mounted the root partition using the mount utility in the AntiX Control Centre (Disks tab &gt; Mount Connected Devices icon).<br>
3. /boot/grub/menu.lst was edited: <br>
"root (hd1,0)" was changed to"root (hd0,0)" <br>
"kernel ... /dev/sdb1 ..." was changed to"kernel ... /dev/disk/by-uuid/&lt;uuid here&gt; ..." <br>
added rootdelay=8 at the end of the kernel line to allow time for USB devices to settle. <br>
removed"boot" in the final line of the section because it's not needed.<br>
4. /etc/fstab was edited: <br>
"/dev/sdb&lt;n&gt;" was replaced by"UUID=&lt;uuid for partition&gt;" <br>
5. /etc/modprobe.d/b43.conf was edited: <br>
I commented out the line containing"install b44 true" by putting a # at the beginning.<br>
Note that the comments within this file refer to a /etc/defaults/mepis-network file/folder which does not seem to exist in the installed AntiX system. <br>
6. I booted the system from the external USB HDD (after removing the Live CD).

SOLVED<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for my silly question. Setting the preferences in Wicd I deleted eth0 (default) and I added manually wlan0 with all the setting, and it works perfectly.</div>
