<div class="content">Hi again! <br>
<br>
Here's a good one for your opinion. My main computer is an Athlon 1-GIG processor w/ 386 MB RAM. It does fine with Mepis and most anything i try on it. My working distro is Mepis (3.4.3, then 6.0, now 6.5) and my only complaint is my lack of knowledge--occasionally i tweak something incorrectly and can't fix it. One instance is adding IceWM to Mepis. It works, but perhaps imperfectly.<br>
<br>
Now Mepis 7.0 is around the corner. I am thinking that before the new year, i will migrate all my home personal files to an external HD, TOTALLY wipe out Mepis 6.5, then install Mepis 7.0, and reinstall my personal files utilizing a separate partition for my Home folder. This, of course, will give me the freshest install possible and is a superior configuration to having my Home folder in root.<br>
<br>
Here's my question: is it better to install Mepis 7 final and use synaptic to add IceWM to it so as to lighten it up, or is it better to install antiX and add all my favorite K-packages? Obviously, the first way gives me all the K-packages ready to roll, but the second means that IceWM (and fluxbox) are installed perfectly. I like the K-apps but don't need the heavy KDE. <br>
<br>
Now, you know from my other posts that i REALLY like antiX! But this computer of mine is big enough for Mepis -- but certainly it isn't the fastest machine around. I'd like, let's say, a light<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>ER</strong></span> version of Mepis, again, with those K-apps around when i need them. What do you think? Which way would be better to get Mepis with IceWM? Perhaps you will spot a flaw in my thinking, that i wouldn't really gain much speed with this setup anyway?</div>

<div class="content">I've wrestled with the same question. Here's my conclusion: <br>
<br>
I started with antiX to see how much work I could get done before I'd miss some KDE app. I was surprised that I could do about anything I wanted to do. When I find I need a certain missing KDE app, I can usually install it. If the install is too big (I'm on dial-up and the support disks are not yet available), I can find a smaller one that works just as well (ex.: kjots is a big install for me right now, but gjots2 is not and works great). <br>
<br>
So it depends on the tasks you need and want to get done. I'd recommend doing this test: start with antiX and see how far you get before you decide you really need to go with a complete KDE setup. If you reach that point, move to full Mepis.</div>

<div class="content">I'd agree with malanrich.<br>
It is better to start with antiX and build up rather than the other way around, especially if you have no intention of using KDE, but just some kde apps.<br>
<br>
My antiX install has 2 kde apps that I use ie k9copy and k3b (though I use k3b less than I used to as brasero does what I need and the newer k9copy uses a command to burn to dvd, whereas in the past it used k3b)</div>

<div class="content">Hey, that's easy! I already have a partition with antiX on it, so i can just start adding things to it and see how it goes without touching the Mepis install. Thanks!</div>
