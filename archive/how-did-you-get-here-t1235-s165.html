<div class="content">First of all thankyou for your work Anticapitalista I am enjoying experimenting with this distro. Works nice in JWM, LXDE, Fluxbox etc.<br>
<br>
I have used many distros including this one on and off over the years. This distro has improved heaps and so may stick with it.<br>
<br>
I came originally from redhat back in the 90's through to Ubuntu then Debian and Puppy Linux. Have to say though Puppy Linux is not what it was package manager seems to have odd behavour now so came to Slackware which I still really like but now I'm trying Antix which is much more flexible to use and chnage to my tastes. <br>
<br>
Once again great work I am enjoying using it.</div>

<div class="content">Hey everybody! I'm new to Antix and still pretty new to Linux as a whole. Don't get me wrong - I've been using Linux since 2009. But as time goes on, I realize more and more the depth of what I got myself into when I decided to break away from Windows... (...break through Windows?)<br>
<br>
As for how I got here: in 2009, I decided I was tired of Windows Vista for myriad reasons and decided that a foray into the unknown was preferable to sticking with the bloated, jumbled mess I already knew. That's when I started researching OSs and came across Ubuntu 11.04. I was instantly more satisfied with my computer's performance, access to the repository, and discovering a little more about what makes my computer tick.<br>
<br>
I stuck with Ubuntu until 2011, when I suddenly developed an itchiness that only an increase in speed could scratch. After a bit of Googling, I came across Crunchbang 10. Before the night was over, I had fallen in love. It had the speed I was craving and it did much less spoon-feeding than Ubuntu - a challenge I was totally into.<br>
<br>
How I came across antiX was sheer dumb luck: a couple of weeks ago I realized a good portion of my software was out of date. I knew I had to update to Crunchbang 11 in order to safely access the Wheezy repository, but, because I'm very poor and the new version is bigger than a CD, my only option for installing it was via DVD - and #! Waldorf and DVD installs have apparently had some troubles getting along. (Note: they said this was fixed, so it could be my old crappy CD/DVD drive, or the crappy operator trying to install it, or whatever). So, I set out to find a lightweight distro that would fit on a CD. I stumbled upon DistroWatch and there I saw an announcement about antiX 13.<br>
<br>
One thing led to another, and I've been happily using antiX ever since <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I feel it's a wonderful combination of being user-friendly and challenging - halfway between my two previous distros. As such, while I've been able to manage on my own for the most part, I have some questions Google and man pages cannot seem to answer. So now I have come to pester you fine folk...<br>
<br>
Thank you to the developers for a brilliant product! I only hope I'm capable of contributing something to you in exchange for your hard work.</div>

<div class="content">Okay - been using Antix since... last night <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Been using Linux since c. 1998. I ran Acorn Archimedes (lovely bit of kit), a friend wanted a program sorted in Windoze so I got a 386 with 20MB(!) hard drive and Win 3.1 on it. (I've still got it, it's been upgraded successively and it's now a AMD64 with three hard drives, two DVD drives, yadda yadda - but like your grandfather's axe, still the 'same' computer). Anyway, when 3.1 got too old for the Intertubes (8.3 filename limitation?) I certainly wasn't going to PAY for the piece of junkthat was early W95, so I tried Red Hat, 5.0 IIRC. Used successive Red Hats till they went to a desktop I didn't like, switched to Debian Woody and I've run Debian on my big box and my several Thinkpads ever since.<br>
<br>
I just picked up a X40 miniature Thinkpad to use as a netbook on a forthcoming trip, went looking for a lightweight Linux (besides, the latest Debian compiles with a PAE-capable kernel and the CPU on this ain't PAE). Thought of Antix, couldn't find clear instructions on a USB install (this X40 doesn't have a DVD drive and I've not done a USB install before), so tried Linux Mint. Mint has a clean-looking 'modern' desktop I actually don't like much, more to the point it's not particularly fast and not as easy to configure as Debian IMHO, so I thought I'd try installing Antix anyway, it could only fail to work, but it was easy - stuck the ISO on a USB key using 'Rufus.exe' under WinXP, and it booted and worked perfectly.<br>
So here I am.<br>
I like the four workspaces (Mint only gives 2 by default and I couldn't find where to fix it), and I do like the Windowmaker-looking menus. Of course I also like that it's Debian-based so all the config files are familiar. Oh, and Antix runs noticeably quicker than Mint on this X40, and quicker than XP SP3 which is currently lurking in a small partition in case I ever need it.</div>

<div class="content">Just had a browse through this whole topic &amp; found out that I hadn't contributed here, so am rectifying that now.<br>
<br>
I've been using Linux &amp; BSD since 1999, started with a command line installation, 'progressed' through 'everything including the kitchen sink' distros, but settled on 'sensible selection' distros. <br>
<br>
Used to install Debian to everything, but now I use Debian based live installable distros. Presently, Crunchbang &amp; AntiX.<br>
<br>
Got into computing in 1995, &amp; progressed to adding/removing software, then hard disks, then everything was fair game. (Started pulling apart desktops &amp; progressed to laptops.)<br>
<br>
Only had broadband internet access for the last couple of years or so, &amp; now spend time in a few forums trying to help out as best I can. No doubt I spend too much time online these days instead of just playing with distros.<br>
<br>
So, see you in the forum.</div>

<div class="content">Hi.<br>
Somewhat jumping the gun here, as I haven't got antiX working yet ! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
But I'm a big fan of lean software and I'm also a big fan of not making <br>
the Rich any Richer, by buying new hardware till the old stuff actually<br>
stops working electrically. So my PC has seen W2K, WXP, Ubuntu,<br>
Crunchbang, Lubuntu, Arch, but I expect antiX will be faster. If so, I'll<br>
be around for a long time, as DSL/Slitaz etc didn't quite work for me.</div>

<div class="content">Well I don't like to get rid of old hardware and i like fiddling with things to get them to work. I've run Ubuntu over the years on some edesktops i salvaged to give to others and have used Knoppix and Puppy as rescue disk. My wife brought an old Compaq 2108US laptop at a yard sale for $5US and I put a new HD in it the proceeded to distro hop till I found something I liked, I tried:<br>
<br>
Ubuntu 12.04- locked up during install.<br>
Mint 13 - See above.<br>
Manjaro-Slow and bad fan/power management.<br>
Vectorlinux7-won't let install continue past formatting drive.<br>
Tinycore-superfast and I like it but you have to do magic tricks to install full to HD-I don't want frugal on this laptop.<br>
LucidPuppy 528- Excellent but had 3 instances of Xorg getting damaged somehow which would put it into an endless loop at boot<br>
Several Pup derivatives-all nice but the ones based on Slacko don't shut the Laptop down properly.<br>
SalineOS-nice, somewhat like Antix from my noob perspective, if i did not decide on Antix this might be on the laptop.<br>
<br>
Then I tried Antix 13.1 and I have been really happy with the results so far; I sestayed with the default windows manager and just removed programs I don't prefer like Asunder and added RipperX, Clementine and XFburn. This machine will mainly be used to provide music/dj duties at get togethers, develop some slide shows for weddings etc and do word processing.<br>
If i come across any more rescuable laptops my intent is to set them up with Antix and remove menu items that might allow new users to accidentally cause harm and then donate them to rural schools in the Philippines. My wife and I send school supplies, clothing and other needed items there and I have sent a few older destops with XP-ugh, I know, installed but they are happy with any assistance and the kids take school very seriously.<br>
<br>
The hard work you put into developing Antix is much appreciated and it's existence contributes both to keeping old hardware viable and out of landfills and allows those with a limited knowledge of Linux to have a functioning system that with some learning on our part can be tweaked to be almost anything one wants.<br>
<br>
Next project is an Athlon 1300XP with 256MB and no HD I salvaged from the trash; I'm going to put an old 20Gig HD I got out of a DVR in it and install Antix. If it turns out OK it will go out to someone that just needs a system to get online.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all your efforts in building Antix.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, zarg2! That is precisely the reason why many of these lightweight systems, antiX included, were created in the first place. At least in your case, it seems to do better than most distributions. Not only can we thank anticapitalista for that, we can thank the Debian project for providing such a rock solid core, and to Warren Woodford for providing the foundations of MEPIS, which were originally used as a foundation for antiX.<br>
<br>
These days, antiX is diverging a bit from MEPIS, but we still can thank that organization for its foundational work that went into antiX. I believe that the Absolute Linux project also provided some pieces that we took advantage of in some earlier work, and of course, the Fluxbox, IceWM, JWM window managers (and the Xfce desktop environment that many of us use) also contribute a lot of great code.</div>

That is a great way to share and to"give back" for what others have done.</div>

<div class="content">I was just hauling some gardening waste to the dump, and I keep being annoyed that people want $100 for an old computer, and rather just throw it away... 99% of them would probably work just fine for many more years.</div>

<div class="content">I have at times found very cheap $20 and less PC's at yard sales and as i noted earlier my wifes $5 find but many folks think any computer no matter how old is worth $50 or more or sadly they just junk them. I am thinking of posting an ad about refubing and donating old systems and seeing if I get any garage cleanouts offered to me. I also bid on old hardware at the Goodwill site at times but they are weird in thier pricing structure. It bugs me that the focus on new hardware waste systems that can be very useful with well written code. i remember the impressive demos from assembly competitions that i used to run on what would be considered ancient hardware.<br>
<br>
anyway I'm very happy to have found Antix and the forums here seem at least as friendly as those over in the Puppy linux community.</div>
