The book was quite a read -- have not seen the movie.<br>
For a backhanded message of Hope, have you seen the 1997 film <em>The Postman</em>? It stars the same guy in <em>Dances with Wolves</em>, is too long and by today's standards, drags a bit -- but a good movie. The AVI just fits on a CD.

 It was filmed in my neck of the woods, too, I see. (I didn't know that -- thanks!)</div>

<div class="content">The Postman was a cakewalk compared to the outlook in this story. At least in the postman, nuclear winter or pre-emptive ice-age and all plantlife dead was not in the story. The only thing left to eat was old canned goods found in old bomb shelters or each other."I identified with the wife when she told her husband,"They will find us. They will rape me and our son. Then they will kill us and eat us!"And what is weird. I could identify with the boy (who is born into this world) and the father who is trying to protect him from the bad in this new world. They did a good job of drawing me in.<br>
<br>
Hope was pretty absent in that story. It was very depressing for me. And I am not a lightweight. Former Jarhead. Lifelong Biker. Decended from WW2 Camp survivors. What got to me I guess was how close it was to some narratives I pried out of my Mom after plying her with a few drinks to loosen her up.<br>
<br>
She is like any War Veteran. Close mouthed to any (especially to her own kids) about what happened in the war. I am the oldest. So she trusts me. I can see that world coming is what bums me out the most I guess. A Hydrogen Bomb is a scary tool and a back breaker, They never say what destroyed all the plant life on earth and made the sky gray when the sun was out. But a dismal prospect at best. Very Hard Story. The Visuals were realistic as hell could be. I won't watch it again.</div>
