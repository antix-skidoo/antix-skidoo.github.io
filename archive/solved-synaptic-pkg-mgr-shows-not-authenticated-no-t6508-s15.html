Public keyservers are pretty much distro agnostic, the <strong>keyserver.ubuntu.com</strong> keyserver is just one that I've had good results with speedwise and usually being available.<br>
<br>
You can use other keyservers in those commands, for instance the hkp://pgp.mit.edu keyserver<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>su -c 'gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 3B07EE13; gpg --armor --export 3B07EE13 | apt-key add - '</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="content">WRAP-UP of"NOT AUTHENTICATED" notification in Synaptics (after installing a printer pkg from Printer manuf)<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes; I was advised and did re-install the"antix_archive_keyring" pkg. That seemed to immediately stop the"NOT AUTHENTICATED" failure notification in Synaptics Pkg Mgr.<br>
<br>
[Then I also re-installed the debian_archive_keyring - although, in the wash-up, that might have been unnecessary.]<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the re-install(s) showed up another"error" - a missing key to one of the Repositories. ("Why?", I don't know, but disabling the Repo gave temporary relief, but was not a proper fix.)<br>
<br>
<br>
For a fix, it seems that I could have used commands to get some key (as recommended by SENIOR Forum Members) but, in ignorance of"meaning" in procedures, I chose some other recommendation as an alternative, simple procedure to download a pkg/cmd"checkdebigpg".<br>
<br>
I used GDebi pkg installer to install checkaptgpg.deb<br>
<br>
After that, in a terminal I used that cmd... checkaptgpg<br>
<br>
Here's the output...<br>
<br>
<em>mypcname# <strong>checkaptgpg</strong><br>
<br>
Checking ftp.au.debian.org_debian_dists_jessie_Release<br>
Good GPG signature found.<br>
<br>
Checking security.debian.org_dists_jessie_updates_InRelease<br>
Good GPG signature found.<br>
</em><br>
<br>
That was it. As you can see the mx Repo wasn't checked. Reason: I hadn't"enabled" the mx Repo within Synaptics, so after"enabling" it, and re-running, here's the output...<br>
<br>
<em>mypcname# <strong>checkaptgpg</strong><br>
<br>
Checking ftp.au.debian.org_debian_dists_jessie_Release<br>
Good GPG signature found.<br>
<br>
Checking security.debian.org_dists_jessie_updates_InRelease<br>
Good GPG signature found.<br>
<br>
<strong>Checking mx.debian.nz_antix_jessie_dists_jessie_Release<br>

gpg: Total number processed: 1<br>
gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)<br>
</strong></em><br>
<br>
<br>
Obviously it went to <em>ubuntu.com</em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">just as Dave and kmathern had tried to drive me to do.</span><br>
<br>
[Oops, what was that? Key from.... ...<strong>gulp</strong>... ..."daveserver". Not"<strong>THE</strong> Dave", I suppose? (Bright red!)]<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, in Synaptics after clicking Reload it checked the Repo's - failed on some tests, which I think was pretty normal <em>before</em> - <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>and then concluded satisfactorily</strong>.</span> So I'm back in the game. Well barracking on the side-lines anyway.<br>
<br>
CLI is not much my thing any more because the memory"overhead" can be staggering. The <span style="text-decoration: underline">.deb pkg that dolphin_oracle recommended</span> did the job - but in"short-hand". [For many of you, you might say: <em>"Yes; he just used exactly the right turn of phrase".</em> Well, excuse me for breathing!]<br>
<br>
<strong>Anyway, thanks to all who helped (both here, and in the other LQ forum).<br>
<br>
Kind Regards,</strong><br>

<div class="content">I guess there is a mirror under mx.debian.nz for antiX as well? That is not only a mx mirror. ...? This is why I do not like the cropped errors in synaptic.... and was trying to get the terminal commands run.<br>
<br>
Strange that you have the antix-archive-keyring package installed yet you were missing the key to the antiX archives also. <br>
I think I am going to try to reproduce that.</div>

<div class="content">Hello, The Dave...<br>
<br>
<br>
This is just an additional comment on the Synaptics Pkg Mgr <em>"held back"</em> stuff, as discussed in earlier posts, and MIGHT be relevant (or not)...<br>
<br>
Today I was looking in Synaptics for a program to install. I found something that I thought would be worthwhile. I clicked on it, and selected"install". Synaptics (as often) told me there were other items that it also needed to include in the install. (Didn't count; guess at 7-ish.) I said"OK". (I happened to notice one item subsequently marked for installation was several items below it in the listing.) <br>
<br>
Then I double-checked some info about the main pkg/program and <span style="text-decoration: underline">decided NOT</span> to install it. Since I knew about the one item nearby, and quickly found another somewhere just above, I UN-checked those too. Unfortunately I forgot the names of all the other pkg/items that were going to be included. [<em>Not so much"forgot", as"hadn't cared, because Synaptics can look after that".</em>] Anyway, I looked through the list several ways (checking for colour/markings) but couldn't find any others. <br>
<br>
So I thought the easiest way to stop this, and"prevent" any bungle, was to QUIT Synaptics. Of course, when I did, it barked at me, warning that I would <em>lose stuff that had been selected</em>. I thought, <em>"Great! That's <em>exactly</em> what I want you to do, Synaptics."</em> CLICK!<br>
<br>
Then I re-opened Synaptics Pkg Mgr to continue with some installations. <br>
<br>
I found some other program, and at the download setup - where Synaptics gives details about the download - I happened to look at (for no particular reason) the number of pkgs"held back" (which is I think the way you describe them). The number was now increased from the number that had been discussed earlier in this thread. <br>
<br>
So, I now ASSUME (something, that often makes a bit of a donkey out of me) that the increase in pkgs held back might be due to the pkgs that I could not locate-and-uncheck, ie the same ones Synaptics said it would drop-on-quit.<br>
<br>
This symptom/mismatch of something <em>bigger</em> is only a hunch. I haven't been checking that number particularly, but I'm pretty certain I have not done any installations since the last comments (your comments) about that"peculiarity" - and, therefore, conclude that the increase is due to today's episode.<br>
<br>
.<br>
Dave, I also want to draw your attention to comments I made in the Mageia forum a loooong time ago about their software updater (which is Synaptics-based too, isn't it?). <br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://forums.mageia.org/en/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=10571&amp;p=61228&amp;hilit=swivel#p61228"<br>linktext was:"https://forums.mageia.org/en/viewtopic. ... vel#p61228"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Despite initial help from that forum's Member(s) I never got a worthwhile conclusion. (I am <strong>NOT</strong> complaining because I think it was my first post - <span style="text-decoration: underline">ever</span> - so perhaps <em>I</em> didn't explain things well enough.) So I cannot really tell if info in the two threads/events are really related - but they <em>could</em> be.<br>
<br>
The essence of <em>that</em> dialogue was:- just by clicking the little"swivels" in the download notification box (ie to open-out the"details") I was getting"update" notices - when I had NOT"checked" anything to update. I mention this because it seems to be in the same area of"oddity" that we are discussing.<br>
<br>
<br>
.<br>
Anyway, hope that helps.<br>
<br>
