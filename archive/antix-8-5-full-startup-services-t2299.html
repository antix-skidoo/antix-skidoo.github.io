<div class="content"><strong>acpid</strong> - Modern computers support the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)<br>
to allow intelligent power management on your system and to query battery and<br>
configuration status.<br>
<br>
ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for delivering<br>
ACPI events. It listens on a file (/proc/acpi/event) and when an event<br>
occurs, executes programs to handle the event. The programs it executes<br>
are configured through a set of configuration files, which can be<br>
dropped into place by packages or by the admin.<br>
<br>
<strong>alsa-utils</strong> - This package contains utilities for configuring and using ALSA, including:<br>
* amixer: command line mixer<br>
* alsamixer: curses mixer<br>
* amidi: read from and write to ALSA RawMIDI ports<br>
* aplay, arecord: command line playback and recording<br>
* aplaymidi, arecordmidi: command line MIDI playback and recording<br>
* aconnect, aseqnet, aseqdump: command line MIDI sequencer control<br>
<br>
ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.<br>
<br>
<strong>console-setup</strong> - This package provides the Linux console with the same<br>
keyboard configuration scheme as the X Window System. As a result,<br>
there is no need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to<br>
make simple customizations such as the use of dead keys, the key<br>
functioning as AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between<br>
Latin and non-Latin mode, etc.<br>
<br>
The package also contains console fonts supporting many of the<br>
world's languages. It provides an unified set of font faces - the<br>
classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the cleaned Terminus,<br>
TerminusBold and TerminusBoldVGA.<br>
<br>
<strong>cpufrequtils</strong> - This package contains two utilities for inspecting and setting the<br>
cpu frequency through both the sysfs and procfs CPUFreq kernel<br>
interfaces.<br>
<br>
By default it also enable CPUFreq at boot time if the correct cpu<br>
driver is found.<br>
<br>
<strong>cron</strong> - The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at<br>
particular times (for example, every minute, day, week or month), as<br>
specific in the in a crontab. By default, users may also create<br>
crontabs of their own so that processes are run on their behalf.<br>
<br>
Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on<br>
their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to<br>
particular users.<br>
<br>
Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator<br>
(or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system<br>
as well so that you can receive these messages.<br>
<br>
<strong>cups</strong> - The Common UNIX Printing System (or CUPS(tm)) is a printing system and<br>
general replacement for lpd and the like. It supports the Internet<br>
Printing Protocol (IPP), and has its own filtering driver model for<br>
handling various document types.<br>
<br>
This package provides the CUPS scheduler/daemon and related files.<br>
<br>
<strong>dbus</strong> - D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.<br>
Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in<br>
terms of complexity.<br>
<br>
D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus<br>
decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be<br>
low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using<br>
XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but<br>
it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.<br>
<br>
It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.<br>
<br>
This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.<br>
<br>
<strong>dhcdbd</strong> - dhcdbd provides a D-Bus interface to dhclient, the DHCP client from ISC,<br>
so applications such as NetworkManager can query and control dhclient.<br>
This allows an application-neutral interface for such operations.<br>
<br>
<strong>eeepc-acpi-scripts</strong> - This package adds support to the special features of Asus Eee PC series of<br>
laptops. These include sleep (suspend) and hotkeys such as wireless,<br>
brightness, mute, volume, video output toggle and the 'soft' keys available in<br>
some models.<br>
<br>
<strong>firehol</strong> - Generates generic firewalls with an extremely simple but powerful<br>
configuration language, enabling you to design any kind of local<br>
or routing stateful packet filtering firewall with ease.<br>
<br>
Firehol does not support ipv6.<br>
<br>
fuse - userspace filesystem framework for Linux<br>
<br>
<strong>gpm</strong> - This package provides a daemon that captures mouse events when the system<br>
console is active, and delivers events to applications through a library.<br>
<br>
By default, the daemon provides a 'selection' mode, so that<br>
cut-and-paste with the mouse works on the console just as it does<br>
under X.<br>
<br>
<strong>hal</strong> - HAL provides an abstract view on hardware.<br>
<br>
This abstraction layer is simply an interface that makes it possible to<br>
add support for new devices and new ways of connecting devices to the<br>
computer, without modifying every application that uses the device.<br>
It maintains a list of devices that currently exist, and can provide<br>
information about those upon request.<br>
<br>
<strong>halevt</strong> - halevt is a daemon that acts as a policy agent on top of HAL. It<br>
listens to HAL events and reacts with user-configurable<br>
actions. It is a reimplementation of ivman project.<br>
<br>
Among other things, halevt is useful as an automount daemon that will mount<br>
removable devices but with a much smaller set of dependencies than tools such<br>
as gnome-volume-manager.<br>
<br>
<strong>hdparm</strong> - Get/set device parameters for Linux SATA/IDE drives.<br>
Primary use is for enabling irq-unmasking and IDE multiplemode.<br>
<br>
<strong>ifplugd</strong> - ifplugd is a daemon which will automatically configure your ethernet device<br>
when a cable is plugged in and automatically de-configure it if the cable is<br>
pulled out. This is useful on laptops with onboard network adapters, since it<br>
will only configure the interface when a cable is really connected. Features<br>
include:<br>
<br>
* syslog support<br>
* Multiple ethernet interface support<br>
* Uses Debian's native ifup/ifdown programs<br>
* Small executable size and memory footprint<br>
* Option to beep when the cable is unplugged or plugged<br>
* Option to beep when the interface configuration succeeds or fails<br>
* Can be configured to ignore short unplugged or plugged periods<br>
* Configure WLAN devices (on detecting a successful association to an AP)<br>
<br>
<strong>ifupdown</strong> - This package provides the tools ifup and ifdown which may be used to<br>
configure (or, respectively, deconfigure) network interfaces based on<br>
interface definitions in the file /etc/network/interfaces.<br>
<br>
<strong>irda-utils</strong> - This package contains userspace utilities to manage and handle infrared<br>
devices. It includes irattach, findchip, irdadump, irdaping and irpsion5.<br>
OBEX tools are removed since 0.9.5. If you need to use IrOBEX,<br>
use openobex-apps package.<br>
<br>
<strong>irqbalance</strong> - irqbalance is a daemon that distributes interrupts over the processors<br>
and cores you have in your computer system, which can lead to better<br>
performance and IO balance on SMP systems.<br>
<br>
The design goal of irqbalance is to find a balance between power<br>
savings and optimal performance. To a large degree, the work<br>
irqbalance does is invisible to you; if irqbalance performs its job<br>
right, nobody will ever notice it is there.<br>
<br>
irqbalance is especially useful on systems with multi-core processors,<br>
as interrupts will typically only be serviced by the first core.<br>
<br>
IRQ load balancing isn't worthwhile until you have more than one<br>
socket, or more than two CPU cores.<br>
<br>
<strong>kbd</strong> - This package allows you to set up the Linux console, change the font,<br>
resize text mode virtual consoles and remap the keyboard.<br>
<br>
You will probably want to install a set of data files, such as the one<br>
in the “console-data” package.<br>
<br>
<strong>keyboard-configuration</strong> - This package maintains the keyboard preferences in<br>
/etc/default/keyboard. Other packages can use the information<br>
provided by this package in order to configure the keyboard on the<br>
console or in X Window.<br>
<br>
<strong>lighttpd</strong> - lighttpd is a small webserver and fast webserver developed with<br>
security in mind and a lot of features.<br>
It has support for<br>
* CGI, FastCGI and SSI<br>
* virtual hosts<br>
* URL rewriting<br>
* authentication (plain files, htpasswd, ldap)<br>
* transparent content compression<br>
* conditional configuration<br>
and configuration is straight-forward and easy.<br>
<br>
<strong>module-init-tools</strong> - This package contains a set of programs for loading, inserting, and<br>
removing kernel modules for Linux.<br>
<br>
<strong>mpd</strong> - Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for<br>
playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams<br>
(Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists. Gapless playback, buffered<br>
output, and crossfading support is also included. The design focus is<br>
on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control<br>
for music playback over a TCP/IP network. The goals are to be easy to<br>
install and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been<br>
reported to run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and<br>
flexible.<br>
<br>
The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the<br>
same computer mpd runs on. The separate client and server design<br>
allows users to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes<br>
independently of the underlying daemon (this package) which actually<br>
plays music.<br>
<br>
<strong>pcmciautils</strong> - This package provides PCMCIA initialisation tools for Linux 2.6.13-rc1 or<br>
later, replacing the old pcmcia-cs tools used with earlier kernel versions.<br>
PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded capabilities<br>
such as network connections, modems, increased memory, etc.<br>
<br>
To use PCMCIA you need to have kernel modules available to support<br>
it. These are included in the stock Debian 2.6 kernel packages. You<br>
will most likely also need udev, although it isn't always required.<br>
<br>
The wireless-tools package is required by many wireless network adapters.<br>
<br>
<strong>policykit</strong> - PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy<br>
that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.<br>
<br>
It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to<br>
granting access to privileged operations (like calling the HAL Mount() method)<br>
for unprivileged (desktop) applications.<br>
<br>
<strong>powersaved</strong> - Provides battery, temperature, ac, cpufreq (SpeedStep, Powernow!)<br>
control and monitoring.<br>
Powersaved is a policy daemon which defines what to do on certain power<br>
management events, like power button presses or ac plug/unplug.<br>
It relies on HAL/pm-utils to do the heavy lifting.<br>
<br>
<strong>pppd-dns</strong> - The Point-to-Point Protocol provides a standard way to transmit<br>
datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard way for the machines<br>
at either end of the link to negotiate various optional characteristics<br>
of the link.<br>
<br>
This package is most commonly used to manage a modem for dial-up or<br>
certain kinds of broadband connections.<br>
<br>
<strong>procps</strong> - These are utilities to browse the /proc filesystem, which is not a real file<br>
system but a way for the kernel to provide information about the status of<br>
entries in its process table. (e.g. running, stopped or"zombie")<br>
Both command line and full screen utilities are provided. Ncurses is needed<br>
for the full screen utilities. More information can be found at procps<br>
website 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://procps.sf.net/"<br>linktext was:"http://procps.sf.net/"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
This package includes the following utilities: top, uptime, tload,<br>
free, vmstat, watch, skill, pmap, pgrep, slabtop and pwdx.<br>
<br>
<strong>rsync</strong> - rsync is a program that allows files to be copied to and from remote<br>
machines in much the same way as rcp. It has many more options than<br>
rcp, and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to greatly speed up<br>
file transfers when the destination file already exists.<br>
<br>
The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the<br>
differences between two sets of files across the network link.<br>
<br>
This package also includes rsyncd daemon functionality.<br>
<br>
<strong>rsyslog</strong> - Rsyslog is an enhanced syslogd supporting, amongst others:<br>
* reliable syslog over TCP and SSL/TLS<br>
* on-demand disk buffering<br>
* email alerting<br>
* writing to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases (via separate output plugins)<br>
* permitted sender lists<br>
* filtering on any part of the syslog message<br>
* on-the-wire message compression<br>
* fine grained output format control<br>
* backup log destinations<br>
<br>
It is quite compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in<br>
replacement. Its advanced features make it suitable for enterprise-class,<br>
encryption protected syslog relay chains while at the same time being very<br>
easy to setup for the novice user.<br>
<br>
<strong>saned</strong> - SANE stands for"Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application<br>
programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any<br>
raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,<br>
video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is<br>
free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The<br>
current source code is written to support several operating systems,<br>
including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available<br>
under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and<br>
backends are welcome, too, however).<br>
<br>
This package includes the command line frontend scanimage, the saned<br>
server and the sane-find-scanner utility, along with their documentation.<br>
<br>
<strong>slim</strong> - desktop-independent graphical login manager for X11<br>
<br>
SLiM aims to be light and simple, although completely configurable through<br>
themes and an option file. It is particularly suitable for machines that<br>
don't require remote logins.<br>
<br>
<strong>sudo</strong> - Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root<br>
privileges to users and log root activity. The basic philosophy is to give<br>
as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.<br>
<br>
This version is built with minimal shared library dependencies, use the<br>
sudo-ldap package instead if you need LDAP support.<br>
<br>
<strong>svgalib-bin</strong> - svgalib provides graphics capabilities to programs running on the<br>
system console, without going through the X Window System. It uses<br>
direct access to the video hardware to provide low-level access to<br>
the standard VGA and SVGA graphics modes. Only works with some<br>
video hardware; use with caution.<br>
<br>
<strong>transmission-daemon</strong> - Transmission is a simple BitTorrent client. It features a very simple,<br>
intuitive interface (gui and command-line) on top on an efficient,<br>
cross-platform back-end.<br>
<br>
This package contains the transmission-daemon and the associated control<br>
interface, transmission-remote.<br>
<br>
<strong>udev</strong> - udev is a daemon which dynamically creates and removes device nodes from<br>
/dev/, handles hotplug events and loads drivers at boot time. It replaces<br>
the hotplug package and requires a 2.6.18 or newer kernel version.<br>
<br>
<strong>usplash</strong> - Usplash is a userspace application that uses the Linux framebuffer interface<br>
to draw a splash screen at boot. It has a companion utility that is able to<br>
send commands to usplash, allowing information about the bootup sequence to<br>
be displayed in a more attractive way.*not sure if it is on final*<br>
<br>
<strong>wicd</strong> - Wicd is a general-purpose network configuration server which aims<br>
to provide a simple but flexible interface for connecting to networks.<br>
Its features include:<br>
wide variety of settings.<br>
* ability to connect to (and maintain profiles for) both wired and<br>
wireless networks;<br>
* support for many encryption schemes, including WEP, WPA, WPA2 and<br>
custom schemes;<br>
* wireless-tools compatibility;<br>
* tray icon showing network activity and signal strength;<br>
* lack of GNOME dependencies (although it does require GTK+), making it<br>
easy to use in Xfce, Fluxbox, Openbox, Enlightenment, etc.<br>
<br>
This package contains the daemon needed to run Wicd.<br>
<br>
<strong>x11-common</strong> - x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further<br>
installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not<br>
provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities<br>
required to run the X Window System.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Some of the above are optional and can be disabled from the <strong>Control Center &gt; System &gt; Choose Services</strong> or even removed/purged from the system. Useful for people how have very limited RAM resources.<br>
<br>
Examples: lighttpd and mpd. Also cpufrequtils/loadcpufreq (laptop or modern cpus only?), cups (printers only), eeepc-acpi-scripts (eeepc only), irda-utils (infrared - like a remote-control, I believe - only), irqbalance (multi-core cpus only), pcmciautils (laptops only), powersaved (laptops only?), ppd-dns (PPPoE/DSL broadband), saned (scanners only) and wicd (wireless/multiple network interfaces).</div>
