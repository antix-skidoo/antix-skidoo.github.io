<div class="content">I haven't had time yet for extensive tryouts. Just downloaded the alpha-3 iso, put it on a stick and tried booting from some old laptops (~10 years) I happen to have around. Both worked flawlessly with Antix 13.2.<br>
<br>
The first one (ASUS Z9200, 768 Mb Ram) booted all right, but Antix couldn't use the screen in native (1280x800) resolution. Gave me an ugly 800x600 in stead. That was the only resolution that showed up in the Control Center. Any easy steps that I could undertake to remedy this? I also didn't see the graphical installer in the menu, but maybe this feature is only added in the final release?<br>
<br>
The second one (Acer Travelmate 6000, 1.5Gb Ram) looked promising: the text screens while booting showed the travelmate's high quality screen being used at full resolution (1400x1050 if I remember correctly), but it crashed in a later stage of the boot process. The final error messages mentioned 'Kernel Panic', whatever that is.<br>
<br>
I also tried booting my main computer (only a few years old, core2 processor, ASUS MB, 4 Gb Ram) from USB with Antix14. All went well there, but my Logitech wireless bluetooth mouse and keyboard were not recognised. That may be rather easy to fix: I remember that the last couple of Ubuntu updates I did suffered from the same problem.<br>
<br>
I am rather pleased with Antix 13.2 as it is, but found some 5y-old HP-laptops and one newer ASUS desktop wouldn't boot it. I hoped that the new kernel would solve that (can't test it right now, the systems involved are kept elsewhere) but it seems to introduce fresh problems.</div>

<div class="content">I think most of this has been covered already in the 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"antix.freeforu ms.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=5305"<br>linktext was:"antiX-14R alpha3 available for testing"<br>====================================<br>
 thread.<br>
<br>
The 32-bit version of alpha-3 uses the 3.15 kernel which has multiple problems. If you have a 32-bit only system, just wait for the next release which will have a better kernel.<br>
<br>
The problem with your display is due to a change in the X-server which now defaults to the fbdev graphics driver if it is available. We don't have a solution (I don't know how to change the default back to vesa) but there are several easy work-arounds. Use the"F7 Console" --&gt;"safe" mode which will disable the framebuffer. We will be changing this default in the next iteration, partly due to the problem you encountered. Another workaround is to use"F5 Video Mode" --&gt;"vesa" to force use of the vesa graphics driver.</div>

<div class="content">Are you using the sysVinit or systemd version?<br>
How did you put it on a stick? I ask as you may not get the full live boot menu with all its options.</div>

<div class="content">@anticapitalista: I chose the sysVinit version. Thanks, Bitjam. I'll check it out tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I'm reading all of the 'antiX-14R alpha3 available for testing' thread. Should have done so first of course. A lot of work has already been done it seems. Not sure I have anything to add to that.</div>
