<div class="content">nice to see you too, roky. from what i quickly searched, there is an option to alter the layout using css (acp &gt; extensions &gt; theme style). but i don't have the time or the inclination to find out what code needs to be added, unlike other idiots that annoys and screws with my theme, tumblr <img alt="ðŸ˜¡" class="emoji" draggable="false" src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f621.svg">, i see that tapatalk doesn't have an option to see the entire code for the layout/theme. i will ask around some friends if they can help me with it or if there is someone trustworthy from the forum that can make a theme or script out of css to change the fonts, background, foreground, avatars, etc. it will helpful. i will have a look over the weekend, but i don't like to mess around with the forum blindly. this is what is written in the theme style section:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Override default css style:<br>
Here you can set custom css to override the main board default style.<br>
e.g.: body { font-family: verdana }<br>
HTML and/or Javascript is not allowed, only pure css (no need to add &lt;style&gt; tags).<br>
Future board updates can break your custom css, so you are the only one responsible to maintain it.<br>
Use it at your own risk, as we cannot provide support for issues related to custom CSS.<br>
<br>
WARNING: Do not use this css to try hide or change board branding and/or other parts that are not the layout/colors of your content, for example you are NOT allowed to modify Tapatalk logo, footer, menu bars, ads, etc... In case of violation of this rule, your css will be deleted and further action may be taken. </div></blockquote></div>

<div class="content">yeah there could certainly be a howto or a guide put up on the forum on how to modify this. <br>
<br>
if for some tos/pos reason we cant do that, im certain it could be put up somewhere, url available via pm...<br>
<br>
as for the idea of an antix subforum (what already exists) on the mx forum-- im sure that already serves its purpose. its having enough room for subforums that sets THIS newly-awful forum apart from the subforum on mx-- <br>
<br>
that said, the subforum is useful for what it is: a subforum about antix on the mx forum. thats not (and probably couldnt be) the same thing we are offered here. <br>
<br>
sometimes a bicycle is useful, and sometimes you need a car. one subforum on another forum is perfect for what its perfect for: for some things, a bicycle is plenty.</div>

<div class="content">looking good rokytnji.Â  and all involved administrators.Â  I was not willing to say that the blue was shocking, until it went gray.Â  gray ok.Â  dark-D found the phrase that says work your hearts content with css but do not expect it to live through a update.Â  Another place tyrannically analyzes that updates are frequent for this reason.Â  Thanks for the help everyone.Â  this forum will someday be judged as very generic; almost fitting with the old antix anti-branding branding.Â </div>

<div class="content">Still learning this stuff. Made some changes to outside border. Edit: Don't Like it so I am gonna try some other color other than maroon. Maroon makes header text dim out.

<div class="content">i got no one to help me with the forum, it looks like i will have to search for codes and tutorials on the net.<br>
i hate that other people break our internet, sites, programs and we are supposed to clean after them.<br>
there needs to be at least two themes one light and one dark because we cannot force users to use one theme. i cannot use anything that is bright and most people can't use dark ones. we need to demand a solution to the freeforum overlords or whats their name or demand that they give use the backup of the forum to move to another provider or a private forum. there was a talk of moving the forum some years ago, but we didn't so we don't loose any valuable information. in retrospective, if we moved, it would be better now. i hope we find a solution to this mess. rant incoming, fell free to ignore it:<br>
<br>
i was pretty pissed off when debian switched firefox-esr to gtk3 without asking anyone and backported it to every version without giving a crap about compatibility or the fact that the stable releases were frozen with gkt2. these days i run over a dozen add-ons and scripts to re-enable or remove features that were removed or added for the sake of the masses or the pride of a programmer. i cannot port my simple gtk2 theme to gtk3, because i need to know scripting or programming and everytime gtk is updated they break all themes. systemd is an intrusive mess with huge logs and dubious agenda hidden by scripts and complicated configuration files. on every dist-upgrade, programs fetch a multitude of useless dependencies, as an example the entire gnupg suite to verify some keyrings or samba-libs for mpv, why!? the unix philosophy of running everything from text files was ruined by corporate agenda and moron programmers and we are left to waste our time to try to repair their mistakes. the freedom to do what ever we want with our computers and programs is disappearing, just like the ability to fix our cars or electronics. the games, movies or music that we buy is not ours anymore, we just rent them. sometimes i become tired of all of this and i just want to give up. i hope that us and others will manage to combat them and keep the free spirit alive for as long as possible. i'm going to bed before i get mad.</div>

this actually proves what a farce the entire open source movement is. dont take my word for it, listen to one of the founders (also author of the debian free software guidelines-- which both became the open source definition and reject documention under the gnu-fdl because it *really* isnt libre.)<br>

<br>
<br>
the open source movement tries to transform a political/cultural movement into a monopoly-friendly technical movement. in that regard its like the ultimate troll-- because it doesnt fool the people it takes from: <br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html"<br>linktext was:"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-sou ... point.html"<br>====================================<br>
 and it doesnt fool the companies they offer it to.<br>
<br>
but even from a TECHNICAL standpoint it fails! because it astroturfs the very notion that there are politics involved-- its purely about a technical solution...Â <br>
<br>
what rubbish.<br>
<br>
the politics of monopoly, of control, and yes of greed, are absolutely a part of what free software stands up to. not business, not (usually) free speech, not a lot of things-- but the part where you just have to"take it or leave it" whatever some big company throws your way-- thats the thing free software defeats.<br>
<br>
<br>
but years of success for the open source movement have tried again and again to simultaneously neuter the politics of free software while getting the movement to reproduce. and theyve produced this weird seedless corporate hybrid where in the words of basil fawlty:"dont mention the war!" because it turns off sponsors-- and we really NEED those sponsors!<br>
<br>
debian has completely jumped the shark, because we have allowed large companies to get too big (even with free software) and though we have the ability to shut them out of monopoly power-- no one is using that ability.<br>
<br>
and so when you have an effective tool for making the world better, and no one uses it or will use it, its very much like you dont have it at all.<br>
<br>
so the whole thing involves more and more compromise until the day when your forums are controlled by a corporation using software that was designed to be controlled by YOU or YOUR organisation.<br>
<br>
you have an operating system controlled by a BIOS that has more authority than your entire operating system and can counteract the os on absolutely anything you do. (if you think thats not true, you missed the conference they just had.)<br>
<br>
and everyone is (allegedly) using a phone or a tablet, so only those users matter to an increasing number of sellouts.Â <br>
<br>
people still have the tools to opt out at any time. but what open source castrates from the free software movement is the notion that there is something political about this-- that there are people running companies who want to take over your forums, have more power over your computers maintenence than you do (even after you remove the operating system they installed) and who very simply<br>
<br>
*dont care about your freedom.*<br>
<br>
and if thats okay, then i recommend"open source." but i started with open source, and i think its become extremely dishonest. no fsf guy is paying me to say it-- i left the fsf behind over their stance on free culture (one thing i admit the open source crowd is sometimes right about.)<br>
<br>
but although open source claims to be"free software [psst: only better]" its really free software, only"dont mention freedom." i mean free is confusing, i used an apple to get online once and everyone said"you should call it 'open produce,' because otherwise the term 'apple' will confuse people-- its just not a good name."<br>
<br>
one of the core tenets of open source-- that it will produce"technically superior" offerings-- is even false, because the compatibility and lack of vendor lock-in was political before it was technical.<br>
<br>
open source loses its technical edge (broad compatibility, user control over their own forums and hardware) almost as quickly as it sacrifices free softwares political message. 2015 was a big year for this with systemd, and this forum going the way it has is just the latest perfect example. more to follow! mozilla? too late. want freedom? keep cutting out monopolies. they arent causing the problem, they are the problem.<br>
<br>
TL;DR:<br>
<br>
as long as people pretend that theres a version of free software that is simply about being practical, non-political and technical, these takeovers will continue to slide under peoples radar.<br>
<br>
if you want to know who really put this fugly forum here, its all of us. take a good long look at it, because its the fruits of too many compromises, too much"making nice" with the suits. not that we shouldnt at times, but too much"making nice" turns eventually into"whatever they want, lets do it and theyll reciprocate!" theres something"reciprocating" alright, but it isnt exactly humanitarian.</div>

Same as it was with freeforums.org, albeit less featureful currently, it's a fremium business model... and on-demand export of your community's db data is not an offered service, is not available at any price. <br>

Expect ala carte paid upgrades, $$per month will unlock accessibility to a number of ready-made themes. Expect $$per month will suppress embedded in-page advertising. Expect that, regardless how many ready-made themes they offer... the themer/designer ecosystem will offer (ala wordpress) paid themes which can be uploaded into place.<br>

Mozilla Corporation has the debian firefox packager maintainer (Mike Hommey) in their pocket. Literally.<br>
He is a paid Mozilla employee, and is a pawn in the agenda being played out by Mozco &amp; partners.<br>
On a related note, lookup: <br>

Wladimir Palant (AdblockPlus creator)<br>

The only notable player among my former list of heroic addon devs who hasn't yet sold out to the corporate interest(s) is Raymond Gorhill (uBlock Origin, uMatrix)<br>
