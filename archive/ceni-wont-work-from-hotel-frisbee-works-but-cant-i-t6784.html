<div class="content">Ceni doesn't work from Marriot Fairfield hotels because they use a secured WiFi with no password, so Antix couldn't connect.<br>
<br>
So I had to go back to SlackoPup, which did work because it uses Frisbee, which has been great at connecting and is easier to use as well as being light, similar to Ceni in that regard.<br>
<br>
I noticed they have Frisbee in the Jessie release of Debian Dog, so I tried converting it to a .deb and installing it via dpkg, but it wouldn't install due to a conflict.<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever looked at adding Frisbee? What might be totally impossible for me to get installed might be a piece of cake for people who know what they are doing like the devs here, me thinks...</div>

Sorry. No. It is not a simple case.<br>
<br>
You cant install frisbee because it was built by jemimah for puppy linux only. The library locations and names are different than debian.<br>
Just because it says Debian Dog. Does not mean it is Debian. Jemimah has since moved on from developing for Puppy Linux.<br>
I ought to know because I was active when Puppeee was in development back in the day.<br>

I downloaded <span style="color: blue">frisbee_1.2-20140602dd64-mod_amd64.deb</span> to my 64-bit antiX16 install<br>
and checked with gdebi }}}"all dependencies satisfied"<br>
(I'm not going to install it. I don't have a wifi ethernet NIC.)<br>
<br>
==========================<br>
<br>
"DebianDog64 - 64 bit DebianDog-Jessie"<br>
livebooted it tonight; it has both some appealing qualities (Jessie w/ sysV init) and some rough edges.<br>
Annoyances like"app config settings won't take, won't stick" and quirks I've never previously witnessed, like roxterm refuses to accept foreground/background color changes (some of the control inputs act 'disabled'). <strong>Anyhow</strong>, on the liveboot PC, frisbee refuses to accept my eth0 setup config details ~~ it displays"invalid IP address" when Save button is clicked. I skimmed the code (/usr/share/frisbee/func) and didn't find why/where is the problem. I can't guess whether all the DebianDog testers/users have only tested it with wifi connections.</div>

Thanks for the efforts. I probably should switch to 64 bit anyway, as I only have 2 machines left that can only run 32 bit. I did try installing the core 64 bit antix 16, but must have goofed somewhere, so need to redo that one... Frisbee is real nice and doesn't eat memory. <br>
<br>
I thought up a solution for Ceni if I'm ever at a Marriot or Fairfield hotel again, I'll enter a password to get Ceni to save it, and then go edit out the password manually, and sleep the machine, and wake it up again to test.</div>

<div class="content">I'm no longer able to connect to the internet from antix on my main machine. Reboot didn't help, and neither did hard wiring. Ceni gets errors, WiCD still dooesn't work, and neither does WPA_Gui, so the machine is literally down as far as antix. It works fine with slacko 5.7.0 which I didn't erase yet.<br>
<br>
What's odd is that it gets an ip address but can't use DNS or even ping my dhcp server<br>
<br>
It worked yesterday, and then stopped about 3 am , and hasnt worked since from antix. Its probably something I did wrong.<br>
<br>
PS: The problem was I screwed up and used the same host name for 2 machines at the same time. and then my main laptop wouldn't connect via wifi anymore. The hardware is known good because it works fine when booted under slackopup.<br>
<br>
I changed the hostname in the hostname and hosts files.<br>
<br>
I noticed that I had no route and figured out that the network cable wasn't working, <br>
<br>
I found away to reset network settings on the pc by going into Ceni and removing the configuration for the cabled ethernet and wifi, and then reconfiguring the wifi.. At that point the error was still there, exactly the same, but I got lucky because the news feed on my conky had put the current news up in the background, so I knew it was fixed, regarless of the errors still being there the same.<br>
<br>
I have to go find that 32 bit Frisbee post.... OOPS: I just DREAMED someone posted a 32 bit Frisbee version that would work. DUH! I must be working too much...</div>

I took my Lenovo 3000 Y410 on a few trips and used the wireless connections from a few hotels, but I also used them in local bookstores and coffee shops. I used wicd quite a bit, so I'm not positive how many times that I used ceni, but I believe that I used it more than once in the past. Let us know how it goes; I don't ever remember having a problem when I used ceni instead of wicd.</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>DREAMED someone posted a 32 bit Frisbee version</div></blockquote>Hmm, I didn't expect the .deb would be treated as an architecture-specific package.<br>
Did you try installing it? (or are just skeptical because of the '64' in the filename?)<br>
It contains a couple bash scripts, a png icon imagefile, an 'AppDir' rox launcher file(?), a .desktop launcher file.<br>
Using gdebi utility to inspect the bash script contents, can copy/paste?</div>

<div class="content">Yes there is. Normally its not an issue because I don't travel often, but happen to be traveling recently, and found that ceni only allows one wifi hookup and when you put in another it is replacing the previous one, so when you go back to that place again, it doesn't remember, and I have to do it over again.<br>
<br>
So, anyway, thanks for noticing and posting it for me. I don't know why I can't ever get WICD to work, again it might be something I did wrong, and will try the frisbee posted...</div>

<div class="content">Yes, it's 64 bit, and I'm running the 32 AntiX on my main laptop (I don't remember why), but it wouldn't install because it was 64 bit only.
