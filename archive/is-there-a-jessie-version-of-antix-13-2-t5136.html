<div class="content">If I was to install and select"testing", is that what I would get, or would I need to do other updates to get a"Jessie" version of antiX 13.2?<br>
<br>
Why? Mostly because Jessie seems to support my nvidia video out of the box, and the only way I found to get it to work under 13.2 was to use an older kernel and nvidia proprietary drivers instead of nouveau, like work automatically with some distros, including Jessie.<br>
<br>
Yes, I know, testing is testing and might not be as stable...<br>
<br>
Any thoughts or suggestions?<br>
<br>

Yep, and when jessie becomes the new stable you will become __________ <br>
<br>
<br>
So use testing. I use em all depending on which laptop,netbook, or desktop. From Wheezy to unstable.<br>
Have fun with it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the reply... I sorta thought that, so gave it a try on a spare drive.<br>
<br>
I loaded it and only got 2 errors when I ran the upgrade, which hopefully weren't major. I will investigate when I get some time this week.<br>
<br>
I've had good luck running Jessie, but the full Debian is just to much for the old laptop.</div>

<div class="content">I think its beyond my ability. <br>
<br>
Python version is wrong causing bleachbit and python-numby not to configure. It appears to want a python version &gt;= 2.7, but only a 2.6.x version was found? These same errors came up on both machines I tried it on. The old dell 8100 machine I loaded using testing repos from the get go, and this 2nd one I initially loaded with stable, then changed sources to testing before doing the update, then upgrade, since I found that method suggested in the meantime.<br>
<br>
And on the newer hp dv9000 I've lost wireless for my atheros 242x / 542x pci card. i see an error that p80211 module didnt load, and from what i read it maybe was left out of the kernel, and i don't have hardwire ethernet here to download anything while running from that partition. I found a post from bitjam to someone else with that same error suggesting they load prism2_usb, so I did that and tried running ceni again, but that didn't solve it. This problem is only on the much newer hp dv9000 laptop I have with me on the road. The old dell 8100 I was testing with at home had both hardwired and wifi access, which might explain why it had no problem with wifi, because maybe it didn't get tested.<br>
<br>
If anyone happens to think they know the answer, I could copy things from log files and post from another partition, but for me to figure it out looks like quite a stretch. I did spend 6 hrs trying, but made very little progress other than finding explanations. Evidently, I need to try:<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>apt-get -f install</code></pre></div>
but that won't complete without being connected to the net, so I'm at an impass until I can either get wireless working, or until I get home next week where I'll have a hardwire connect available.</div>

<div class="content">I had that with an old Nvidea machine. It works wirh AntiX12, set on wheezy - it must have a &gt; 3.6 Kernel.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately it passed away and went to the happy computing home in the sky, so I can't give up-to-date info.</div>
