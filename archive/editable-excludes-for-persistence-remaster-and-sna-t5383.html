<div class="content">Skidoo has suggested that we store the excludes for these programs in a central place and make them easy for users to edit. I think this is a terrific idea and it is time to do it.<br>
<br>
Remaster-live and persist-save (now) store their exclude lists in variables in the file /usr/local/lib/antiX/antiX-excludes.sh. I believe the snapshot program holds its exclude info in a different format and in a different location. I like the idea of"common excludes" that are combined with specific excludes for persistence, remastering and snapshots. To make them easier to edit, the lists should be stored directly in 4 files:<br>
<ul>
<li> common-excludes</li>
<li> remaster-excludes</li>
<li> persist-excludes</li>
<li> snapshot-excludes</li></ul>
The logic would be we combine the common-excludes list with the specific excludes for the particular program. We would honor comments both before and after the file names. I already have some simple code that does this sort of thing as part of our build system.<br>
<br>
We should try to make it as easy for the user as possible and then work around that. I don't know if combining common-excludes with a specific $PROGRAM-excludes will be easier for the user but I would hate to have four different lists that are almost the same. That sort of thing drives me bonkers. We can also have a .orig copy of each file that is read-only.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have ideas or suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Sorry to hear that"different, but almost the same, lists" drive you bonkers. I'm convinced such is necessary.<br>
For your default lists (the lists you distribute), an entry YOU deem desirable for the"common" list... I may disagree.<br>
For that item, I may wish to exclude it from ONLY remaster operations... and I need to go hunt/kill it over in common.<br>
A good example here, I think, is <em>/</em>var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb<br>
-=-<br>
Hmm, phrase it like this:<br>
The separate lists are task-specific ~~ that's why they are (should be) separate, separately maintained.<br>
The"common" list, I'm suggesting that should only contain the MUST exclude (or else will break things) entries.<br>
<br>
If I never remaster, I probably don't (ever) care to look inside the remaster list.<br>
When I perform a snapshot, I damn sure want to see every relevant entry... and referring back-n-forth between lists is PITA.<br>
It's reasonable to expect a user will need to tweak his list(s) often, incrementally (outweighs infrequent dev PITA in"maintaining" the default lists).<br>
<br>
A"default" remaster list cannot <em>responsibly</em> cover every consideration.<br>
For that list, an inline comment should remind the would-be remasterer to consider what<br>
(tweaked configs for installed apps) needs to be copied to etc/skel, in addition to what should/must be excluded.<br>
<br>
Regarding"persist-excludes", exposing its content to the user would be enlightening, even if s/he never has need to edit it.<br>
<br>
Ideally (eventually) a comment line would precede each entry, explaining why excluded (and whether or not user might change).<br>
Some of the patterns can be commented in blocks ( proc / run / srv ) but many do merit individual explanation.</div>

<div class="content">reminder: an issue illustrated in the July 2014"snapshots not working as expected" thread<br>
snapshots-not-working-as-expected-t5211.html<br>
In this example case, botched snapshot result occurred due to the pattern <span style="color: blue"><strong>media/*</strong></span> within <strong>/</strong>usr/lib/antixsnapshot/snapshot_exclude.list<br>
<br>
related (usability issue):<br>
because EVERY non-commented, non-blank line within the <strong>excludes</strong> file is an EXCLUDE pattern<br>
<span style="color: red">{</span><strong> - </strong><span style="color: red">}</span> usr/share/fuzzydice<br>
<span style="color: red">{</span><strong> - </strong><span style="color: red">}</span> home/*/thumbsuckers/large/*<br>
having the parser expect/require a BOL minussign character for each pattern line within the excludes file is $!#&amp;@ ...um, is not ideal. compared to refractasnapshot<br>
<br>
======================<br>
<br>
<strong>proposed conventions for content and format of excludes lists:<br>
<br>
1) </strong>Each item (aka path, rule, pattern, regex pattern) in an excludes file should begin with a forward slash character, which serves to"anchor" it.<br>
<br>
<strong>2)</strong> A comment paragraph atop each list should describe, in a nutshell, the intended purpose of its associated script.<br>
This header should also provide a reference link ( /path/to/local/doc or URL to online wiki / discussion thread ).<br>
Ideally (for best results) the user should thoroughly review the external documentation.<br>
Nonetheless, generous inclusion of Inline comments throughout each excludes file is recommended.<br>
<span style="color: green">#Bear in mind that users will<br>
#typically edit the list using<br>
#a text editor and that<br>
#linewrapped comment<br>
#text is $!#&amp;@ hard to digest.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>3)</strong> In the default list(s), 3 hash chars BOL to preface an"important" line item (or group of lines)<br>
<span style="color: purple"><strong>### these paths, if present, MUST be excluded ! (else bad things will happen)<br>
### Yes, some of the top-level dirs listed here, e.g."cdrom", might not currently exist in your system.<br>
### If so, no problem... and it's advisable to, just In case</strong><br>
<strong>/</strong>cdrom/*<br>
<strong>/</strong>dev/*<br>
<strong>/</strong>live<br>
<strong>/</strong>media/*<br>
<strong>/</strong>mnt/*<br>
<strong>/</strong>proc/*<br>
<strong>/</strong>swapfile</span><br>
<span style="color: red"><strong>/srv/*</strong></span> this line is absent from the current antiX default excludes list? <span style="color: purple"><br>
<strong>/</strong>sys/* <br>
<strong>/</strong>tmp/*<br>
<strong>###</strong></span> perhaps followed by a matching"end of section" marker, at least for large multiline groupings<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>4)</strong> In the default list(s), a comment line bearing a single hash char BOL precedes an"optional" line item (or group of lines)<br>
<span style="color: green">#OPTIONAL: can safely exclude the following, if present; the system will automatically regenerate it during boot.<br>
# filesize is typically 2Mb+ (its"squashed" size within the resulting snapshot will be considerably less, though)<br>
# (its exclusion yields a smaller snapshot image. OTOH, regenerating it each live session adds 2-3secs boot overhead)<br>
# <em>/</em>var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db</span><br>
^--- just serves as a formatting example here.<br>
Admittedly, for an optional item which would be outcomented by default and is accompanied by several comment lines...<br>
...mentioning it within the external docs instead of cluttering the excludes file may be preferable.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for suggesting ### section headers, fatmac. My hope for the"number of hashes" suggestion was to visually emphasize optional vs advisable vs necessary exclusions.<br>
I agree that section headers are helpful, but only to a point -- after which, they begin to seem too restrictive.<br>
In my use, I've found that a ---DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE--- approach, with optional items grouped further down the list... became a hassle.<br>
When grouping items based on {to save space} {privacy} {system will recreate these each boot} {system will recreate if/when needed} too often a given item seems to 'overlap', defying placement in just one group.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We would honor comments both before and after the file names.</div></blockquote>That's interesting. I don't think I've ever tried tacking on end-of-line comments. I've just placed my comment line(s) immediately above the associated pattern line.<br>
Placing comments end-of-line would reduce my snapshot exclusion list quite a bit.<br>
<br>
Reading"file names" in the post I've quoted reminds to mention confusion introduced by mix-n-match terminology.<br>
In my post above, I was careful to write"Each item (aka path, rule, pattern, regex pattern) in an excludes file"<br>
because a given item may result in the exclusion of<br>
{one specific file}, or {a directory}, or {everything beneath the named directory, but not the directory itself} or {all files with matching names}, or...<br>
<br>
Pick a card, any card. Throughout the docs (and discussions) we need a consistent name/term for"a non-comment, non-blank, line within an excludes file".<br>
Separately, typing"snapshot excludes file" (or"snapshot exclusions list") seems awkwardly verbose, yet necessary, with multiple exclusion lists in the mix.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We should try to make it as easy for the user as possible and then work around that.</div></blockquote>Without inline commentary, the user probably won't realize that new, empty, the top-level dirs 'media, proc, sys, tmp' et al<br>
are created in the working directory... and is left wondering"Why do 'swapfile' and 'live' items lack tailend slash-asterisk compared to the others?"<br>
<br>
The default lists currently contain only a few dozen lines. These can be easily grouped, and commented.<br>
I was suggesting expansion of the default lists, so that they contain additional, initially-outcommented, items<br>
in order to convey recommendations and to illustrate useful regex-based patterns (relevant, useful, patterns. Just uncomment to activate)<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I don't know if combining common-excludes with a specific $PROGRAM-excludes will be easier for the user<br>
but I would hate to have four different lists that are almost the same.</div></blockquote>Back in 2012 (?) I posted"Consider the status quo, from a user perspective" and I spelled out (walked through) the scenario of"not being able to see the forest through the trees":<br>
(I'm explaining, not ranting) <br>
Find/open antixsnapshot... find/open the antix-common script which is"sourced" by antixsnapshot... figure out"who da hell defines 'du_excludes', and where"...<br>
Ultimately, I reached the conclusion that the antixsnapshot mechanism wasn't usable for me (wasn't acceptable, didn't produce a desired result)<br>
due to hard-coded exclusions stipulated in the"shared" (focused on remastering) exclusions list.<br>
Under this status quo, user expects, but cannot acheive: <strong>snapshot == faithful copy of the running system</strong><br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We can also have a .orig copy of each file that is read-only</div></blockquote>That sounds like a good idea, along with advising user to backup his customized list(s).</div>
