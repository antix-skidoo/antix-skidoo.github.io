<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br>
<br>
I hadn't noticed this before but only became aware after re-reading a review of antiX 13.1.<br>
<br>
From the Meta Package Installer, other Window Managers can be installed.<br>
<br>
Therefore, as bandwidth is limited, before I download anything, I would like to know if the following can be achieved by installing the KDE-lite (kde-plasma-desktop) and the LXDE-basic (lxde) packages.<br>
<br>
With both these Window Manager packages and the kio-mtp package installed, would I be able to use the Dolphin file manager with the LXDE desktop environment and have a PTP Digital Camera automatically mounted in Dolphin?<br>
<br>
Would nepomuk or akonadi be activated as a service when the system is initialised? I'm hoping that they aren't given that they can be heavy on memory resources.<br>
<br>
Thanks, MTB.</div>

<div class="content">IMO, its best to find something that works and then tweak the performance.<br>

All the performance in the world does you no good if you can't do what you are trying to do.<br>

Download while you sleep. <br>

From what I've seen, the KDE desktop itself is not performance oriented, but I have installed KDE programs on other desktops. They drag in a lot of dependencies, but if that's what it takes to get the job done, as long as you have the space, it better than having something that doesn't work. I have never tried the KDE lite desktop, though, so you might find its"light" enough to be ok, I don't know, and that's why I suggested just downloading it while you sleep.</div>

I have noticed that your"spelling" is getting"betterer and betterer" all the time. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Hope I can get to that level of knowledge and tweaking sometime.<br>

Great minds think alike; I've been thinking the same thing <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> and some quirks with the interface (e.g. jerky resizing of LXTerminal) and lack of responsiveness from, and usability of, the Forums of GALPon MiniNo have put me off, some, of that distribution.<br>

Time/Speed is not the problem, so much, but the combined limit of downloads and uploads per month.<br>

I'm hoping that I may only need to install the Dolphin package, which pulls in the kde-runtime, and the kamera and kio-mtp packages but I'm about to pop over to the

<div class="content">That's an unfortunate constraint because it will prevent you from having the opportunity to try different distros and setups. Almost every time I try a different one I find new good ideas, and perhaps some that need improvement. <br>
<br>
Is there free wifi at schools or libraries, etc that maybe you could use?<br>
<br>
Yes, I've noticed there are quite a few distros where I seem to be the only person in the past few months asking any questions. But then again, some of those small distros are actually quite good. But yes, if there aren't many people involved, there is a higher likelihood that support could stop or jyou just don't know if or when anything miight get fixed. WattOS comes to mind there. It was quite active for a while, but then the problems of the mixed architecture became apparent, and then made it difficult to support as well, I think. Once Jessie goes stable I'm guessing a lot of the smaller distros that are Debian based will be able to get back up to speed.</div>

Nup, nothing like that here in the valley. Maybe if you were a Uni student in Cusco but I don't know about that.<br>
<br>
Most of the distros, I have downloaded, I have downloaded at an Internet Cafe because it is cheaper to pay for an hour or two's time there then to add on MBs or GBs to my monthly quota.</div>
