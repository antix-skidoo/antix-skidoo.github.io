Downloading the ISO file may require right-clicking and selecting the"Save Link Target As:" option. I just added this note to the web page. I'll have to figure out how to allow the ISO file to download from the normal left-click.</div>

Thanks for the feedback in your review. I would have preferred a better review, but then, it's nice just to be publicly acknowledged. Some questions about your review:<br>
1. What are the reasons for using a static size drive in Virtualbox? So for, I've only used the dynamic size.<br>
2. How could the software have been older than that of the current release of antiX Linux given that antiX Linux is my base? Since this was my very first release, I didn't get around to changing very many things. That said, I did configure Synaptic to favor packages from the stable branch, so if you added packages, that's why they felt old. In the trade-off between stability and being up-to-date, I'm clearly favoring stability.<br>
3. How was changing the background more difficult in Swift Linux than in antiX Linux? What worked in antiX that didn't work in Swift Linux?<br>
<br>
I removed Fluxbox in Swift Linux. I find IceWM (as implemented in antiX full) to be MUCH more user-friendly than Fluxbox. I figure that those who prefer Fluxbox and no desktop environment prefer the antiX default configuration. <br>
<br>
In creating Swift Linux, I'm aiming for users of Windows, Puppy Linux, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint. I have lots of work to do on many fronts, not only improving Swift Linux but also in building a Swift Linux community, figuring out what software license to use, promoting Swift Linux, entering Swift Linux on Distrowatch, and probably additional tasks that I haven't even thought of.</div>

I see you found my comments. I had intended to mention them here. Regarding repositories, I use Testing, so I'm sure that is why there was such a huge discrepancy between Lenny and Squeeze - on the order of seven hundred packages. Usually that is nothing, but in a Virtualbox environment, it caused the actual upgrade, which was also backed by relatively a relatively slow external USB drive, to take quite a while. Undoubtedly had I installed it over antiX or another partition on my hard drive, it would have been considerably faster.<br>
<br>
I don't know why, but I simply was not able to get any wallpaper background other than a drab looking gray, even though I selected one of them - Ocean Bliss is always one of my favorites. Maybe that also had something to do with running in the VB, but I wouldn't know what. Other systems run in a VB all the time and they are configurable, so something was wrong. I could SEE all the usual backgrounds in the tool, that is what was particularly exasperating, but even after making a selection, no change was made. All I could change were the window and task bar themes.<br>
<br>
I usually just run dynamic partitions with Virtualbox. Most of the time I just run distributions Live. If I am going to install them in the VB, then sometimes I will allocate fixed space. It takes a pretty long time to secure the space initially, but then subsequent access can be significantly faster.<br>
<br>
I'll see if I can set aside a place to at least temporarily install this build - though if you are planning on creating another one pretty soon, I may prefer to wait upon it. I notice that there are not many - if any - Swift Linux identifiers - most things say"antiX" - do you intend to keep this as antiX or is that something to see in 0.1 or 0.2?<br>
<br>
I think that in time you'll be able to do something really cool with this. From my perspective, at this stage, it looked like a simple remaster, with very little changed. The only obvious thing I noticed were the icons on the desktop and the fact that I couldn't change the background. Oh yes, one other thing that wouldn't start or toggle for me: Conky. Perhaps whatever is making that ugly gray background is the same thing that is keeping me from seeing Conky displayed. Is Icewmbg set up properly?</div>

Version 0.0.1 is coming out soon, though there won't be that many obvious changes, and I didn't address your critiques. Forensic Swift Linux 0.0.1 will have more changes than regular Swift Linux 0.0.1.<br>
<br>
In Swift Linux, I have the ROX Pinboard activated by default. I deactivated the default wallpaper (mostly black picture of the Earth), because it made it hard to see things on the desktop. I disabled and removed Conky because the ROX Pinboard covers it up. I also have other packages removed, as I plan to later offer a version of Swift Linux with OpenOffice included but want it to still fit on a CD. (Don't worry - I will give users the choice between an edition with OpenOffice and an edition without. I want to offer a version with OpenOffice to appeal to Ubuntu and Linux Mint users, but I will still offer a version without it to appeal to those who don't want the bloat.)<br>
<br>
I activated ROX Pinboard as default to make the distro look and feel more like Puppy Linux, Linux Mint, and Ubuntu. I included the flashblock and noscript packages so that users could disable those animations and scripts that go haywire and freeze up the browser and sometimes the computer as well. Users can still easily disable these features.<br>
<br>
For version 0.0.2, I will be sure to address the wallpaper issue. For now, I have Swift Linux configured with no wallpaper, which is why the background is a dull gray. It's dull, but at least it doesn't make the icons harder to read. I may change the color in the future, and I also plan to later offer Taylor Swift Linux and other special themes (analogous to Hannah Montana Linux).</div>

<div class="content">OK, I think that explains my questions. For my own particular interests, I'd rather stick with the approaches that anti has taken, but I believe I now understand where you are coming from and what your priorities are. With that understanding, I'd still be glad to check out your releases and see how you are doing, though other than testing, I just find that antiX better suits my own personal needs and interests. I've been working with it for a long time and I have had a lot of feedback into it.<br>
<br>
I do find it <strong>exciting</strong> that you have found it to be a solid platform on which to build your own creations, and I am interested enough in them (even though they don't suit my every day interests and needs). In spite of my critique, I do think you are doing some VERY interesting things, and I look forward to those next two base levels to see what you come up with!<br>

Keep up the good work, <strong>I am rooting for you!</strong></div>

<div class="content">I wrote another blog entry at the IT Toolbox that includes a few quotes from our conversation and I think my follow up blog puts your work in a better light, allowing you to explain what you are doing and where you are going with your work. I hope you value the comments.<br>
<br>
As far as some things that you may consider doing in the interim, if you do not intend to use Conky, perhaps you might consider removing the Conky toggle feature in the menu. Same thing in the interim with the desktop wallpaper choices; consider disabling or removing them until whatever choices you offer are included in the kit. Perhaps you won't be able to get to these things right away, but those are the kinds of attention to detail that will make a difference for potential followers of your work.<br>
<br>
Keep it up! Despite my differences in preferences, I still like and greatly appreciate your work! If you want to look at the newest blog entry, check it out at

<div class="content">I like the Taylor Swift Edition in particular. The images are attractive, yet not too"racy", the software is simple and easy to use. It is a very nice alternative to antiX and considering that it's based on antiX, it shows once again how flexible MEPIS and antiX really are, and we could say the same thing about Debian and Linux as well.</div>

<div class="content">I'm posting from Swift (Regular 0.1.1) now and enjoying it. Its desktop is clear and well laid out and the distro itself is fast and responsive.<br>
<br>
I do have a suggestion to make though;, would it be possible to have an icon show up on the desktop whenever a pendrive is plugged into the machine, and which could be clicked on to open the folder, dragged and dropped to etc.? This would make it a lot easier for newbies to find their existing files and add new ones.<br>
<br>
I tried to run AntiX 8.5 on a computer in a community centre a year or two ago, and unfortunately it received the"thumbs down" from users because they had difficulty in finding Word documents etc. that they had brought in with them on a pendrive. I coped because (although no expert) I'm a lot more used to Linux than most of the centre's users were.<br>
