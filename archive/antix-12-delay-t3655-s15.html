Though I don't multiiboot like I used to. <br>
<br>
Any body running grub4dos on a mbr will install Antix grub to root partition to add entries in grub4dos menu. Just mentioning this. grub4dos pretty much works like grub legacy. Not grub2.<br>
<br>
I just mention this because a lot of Puppy linux users use grub4dos as primary bootloader for mbr.</div></blockquote>
Given this information, do you think this is a potential problem when you use antiX with Puppy and grub4dos? Considering the capabilities we already have inherent in GRUB 2 when it is installed on the MBR in antiX, plus the antiX Live CD (or any one of numerous other recovery tools), unless someone can think of an area where we are unreasonably exposed for some users, these alternatives seem to be pretty solid. Any other ideas? So far, I'm leaning on the side that we have this covered, but I am interested in other opinions as well.</div></blockquote>
Since I don't multiboot anymore Brian like I used to about a year ago when I had my IBM M41 Desktop which mulitbooted numerous puppy linux spinoffs I can't really know if the new legacy grub to root partition in Antix install will be a problem or not. I have pretty much upgraded my equipment. Gave that IBM M41 away (with windows xp on it to a senior citizen friend of my wife). Every Hardrive I have now is dedicated to only one operating system per hardrive (mostly). If I choose to try out something. I use a pendrive install since most of my gear supports pendrive boot and I also have a PLOP floppy boot manager for the IBM A22M that does not support usb booting. So I have no clue as to what problems may arise with the grub4dos type of install anymore like I used to.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>roky, would grub4dos users add antiX entry manually?</div></blockquote>
There is 2 options for putting the antix entry into grub4dos in puppys gui grub4dos window. One can do it automatically. Or one can do it manually.<br>
I guess it depends on the user on how they decide to go and also their skillset on editing a menu.lst in grub4dos which looks and acts a lot like legacy grub.<br>
I have some old grub4dos menu entrys in this forum somewhere.<br>

<div class="content">Thanks a lot for the update Roky! It sounds like you wouldn't have an issue with the way that antiX works, with or without root partition loading of the boot loader because your current setups would all install to the MBR.<br>
<br>
I think our biggest concern will be to make sure we have a strategy or a workaround, with documentation, in the event that we are unable to resolve the current boot loader issue. One reason I want to chat with others is that this kind of stuff is not an issue for me at all, but I have enough boot loader knowledge to work around issues. For example, one of the first builds of SimplyMEPIS, back when Warren Woodford was preparing for SimplyMEPIS 11.0, had an issue with the boot loader. It was probably a small typo in the configuration, but it left the boot loader with an invalid syntax. It was a really simple matter to fix by hand, but not everyone would know how to do that, and that would be a"deal breaker" for them. Warren knew that, of course, and fixed it with the very next build.<br>
<br>
For us, the fewer issues we have, the greater likelihood we have of keeping the antiX users we have and attracting more new ones. So if I can help find a solution, I sure will do so. Still, I am guessing that this is likely to impact only a small percentage of those who use our software.<br>
<br>
I'm going to look at the code that anti made available and see if I can understand it well enough to figure out what's going on.</div>
