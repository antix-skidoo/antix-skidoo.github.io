<div class="content">I shouldn't be the one answering, but my guess for starters would be at least 3. I've had that same experience with a number of other distros, and interestingly, in some cases, I think they want it to be their show, regardless of the effort required, and I think in time carrying all the load weighs on them, or things in personal lives change to where they just can't carry the load.<br>
<br>
Also, the rest of us should at least try to pitch in and carry a bit of it ourselves, too, if we are expecting them to put in the effort. Not that we are all able to do major things, but if each would at least try to help, the ball moves forward and the heavy lifters will feel more appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">I'd say there are three main devs here: anticapitalista, Dave, and myself. Of course there are other people here who contribute <em>enormously</em>. Over the past few years, we've invested heavily in our infrastructure, making the production of iso files easier and much more reliable. This allowed us to start releasing 64-bit versions in addition to the 32-bit versions. So on each major release we put out six iso files.<br>
<br>
In additions, our tools (in theory) made it possible for us to collaborate with the Mepis devs and create the MX respin of antiX. This was a lot more work than we expected. Like CrunchBang, Mepis had lost their lead dev but they still had a vibrant community of developers so we stepped in to collaborate and now MX seems to be thriving. If we got the blessing of corenominal, and some help from #! users/advocates/devs then we/they could make a #! respin of antiX. If you are looking for a distro with a larger development community then you might want to try 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://forum.mepiscommunity.org/index.php"<br>linktext was:"MX"<br>====================================<br>
.<br>
<br>
If you have an idea of which packages need to be included, we could probably have a decent working proto-type of a #! respin in a day a two (if we dropped what we are doing now). Certainly an openbox respin of antiX should be a piece of cake. I could probably make a working openbox version of antiX in less than an hour.<br>
<br>
OTOH, the end of #! is another poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Is it better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all? I say yes, definitely love and loss is better. The Sufis tell us to"die before you die". That is, give up our attachments to impermanent things but we can still enjoy them while they/we are here.</div>

It makes openbox another option on antiX like JWM or WMII was. The things missing are the change to the Ice, Flux, JWM and other wm menus. It includes the menu template and tint2 setup, etc, with menus very similar to the other antiX wm's.</div>

<div class="content">At the time, I had just been working with Crunchbang for a week, and so, since I thought it was quite a good implementation of openbox, I tried to copy or mimic its good features as much as I could as long as they didn't conflict with antiX, and in some cases, I used antiX standard programs for improved implementation of mimicking crunchbang features, like the recent files thing, where I used spacefm to do it automatically, since its included in the distro, rather than building a pipe menu out of xdg data as crunchbang had done. I also went one better on the menus, IMO, because I did mine as static menus, similar to the way I'd built them using obmenu-generator for Manjaro OpenRc, but using an antiX style template to arrive at a similar result, generated along with all the other menus (like for JWM, Flux and Ice), rather than using the openbox pipe menus, which perform with noticable delay on older crap hardware like my test machines. <br>
<br>
Anyway, yes, it would be a very easy transition, because I also used tint2 like crunchbang did, having gotten much of my conky ideas from their code and over on their forum, so its implemented in a similar manner, within the antiX mindset that openbox is another window manager view of that same desktop, switchable from or to easily.</div>

Nice work, and your tests have shown that it would not take a lot of work to fit OB in along with #!'s keybindings to AntiX...that would surely help Crunchbangers make the transition to AntiX as AntiX shared many of the same goals as #!.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, that's what had attracted me to Crunchbang as well as antiX, and it just happened that I had gotten into the openbox setup and menu generation when the Manjaro OpenRc one was incomplete, and the Manjaro Openbox one was also the dynamic pipemenu that was too slow to run on my old clunkers.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you everyone for your responses. It appears from the responses that I can expect antiX to be around longer than CrunchBang. However, I know that all things eventually do come to and end. I'll just have to hope antiX is around for as long as I am.<br>

By the way, I have used antiX and made it to resemble CrunchBang. Here's my screenshot of the effort on one of my laptops:<br>

MX is a bit bloated for my needs. I prefer a very minimal install and then add the packages I want to use. As far as collaborating with Corenominal and the CrunchBang community, you might consider registering over at the forums and make your suggestion there. There seems to be a desire to keep the CrunchBang distro going, so maybe a number of users would be interested in what you are offering.</div>
