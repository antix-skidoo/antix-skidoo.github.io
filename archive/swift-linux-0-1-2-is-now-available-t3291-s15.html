<div class="content">Hey Jason, I don't know if I mentioned it or not, but I grabbed 0.1.2 a while ago and it continues to improve and it works great. I have run into something that seems to be a hardware compatibility quirk, and it is not unique to Swift Linux, it seems to apply to antiX and probably to SimplyMEPIS as well. On my Gateway portable the sound works automatically and fine, but I can't consistently get sound out of my Lenovo laptop. Whatever sound hardware it uses, it is inferior to the Gateway in this respect. I suspect there are some inexpensive, proprietary components used there that aren't on the Gateway, though the bridges and stuff at the bus level appear to be nearly identical. So that issue is definitely not a Swift Linux-specific issue; everything else is awesome!</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>swiftlinuxcreator wrote:</cite>Colonel Panic, I'm glad you were able to get version 0.1.2 to install on your computer.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why the installation window didn't show up that one time you tried to install Swift Linux, as it never failed to show up during my installations. <br>
<br>
That said, old equipment sometimes behaves in strange ways with modern operating systems. The 11-year-old computer (467 MHz Pentium II) I gave away earlier this year didn't work with antiX Linux on a CD-RW. antiX Linux did work with a CD-R and with Puppy Linux on a CD-R or CD-RW. I never did find out why the antiX/CD-RW combination was problematic.<br>
<br>
The CRT monitor that I disposed of at Best Buy earlier this year also had a strange quirk specific to antiX Linux. If I tried to boot up antiX Linux with the monitor turned off or connected to a different computer (through a KVM switch), I found when I switched back to the computer booting antiX Linux that the monitor would be dark and all of its lights at the bottom would be flashing. But when I rebooted AND kept the monitor on and connected to the computer, antiX Linux booted up with no problems at all.<br>
<br>
I suspect that the developers of upstream distros or possibly even the Linux kernel decide to omit drivers for old equipment that they don't expect people to still be using.</div></blockquote>
Hi, thanks for replying.<br>
<br>
I don't think it's worth worrying about to be honest, it seems to have happened just the once and only on my machine. If other people report the same *fault - as, for instance, there seems to be a fault in installing Mint 11 LXDE where the installer hangs on low memory machines when setting the timezone - I'd say it was something which needed looking into.<br>
<br>
But as things stand, don't let anything detract from the fact you've done a great job with this distro.<br>
<br>

* Yes, I did report that to the Mint devs and they told me there's a low resourtce desktop I can boot from the boot options and which shoulsd alleviate the problem I forget the name of it now -Ubiquitous or something</div>
