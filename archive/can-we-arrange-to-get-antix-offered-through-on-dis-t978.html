<div class="content">Anticapitalista,<br>
<br>
I have been very encouraged as I have used antiX and I have been happy to give back to the project by testing and providing feedback, suggestions, and comments. antiX is now one of my two favorite distributions (sidux is the other one).<br>
<br>
I would like to be able to contribute to the project in a financial way, and also get others from the USA to do the same. 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://portal.on-disk.com/"<br>linktext was:"http://portal.on-disk.com/"<br>====================================<br>
 has a program where they can, upon approval from a development group, offer CDs, DVDs, and USB sticks (also in what they call GUFI form) to customers. On-Disk,com charges the customer for their development costs, a modest margin, and they also collect a certain amount per sale, which, when registered, they send directly to the development project of the software being used. Mozilla is in their list, so is Zenwalk, Ubuntu, OpenOffice, openSUSE, LinuxMint, PCLinuxOS, and others.<br>
<br>
I would like to see antiX added to that list, and I would be glad to purchase a GUFI configuration of antiX from them, with a portion of those proceeds going directly to the antiX project.<br>
<br>
Would you be willing to sign up with them so that I have a convenient way to financially support this project, in addition to my current testing efforts? I would be very pleased to do so if you can give me this USA media access point.<br>
<br>
If that is impossible for some reason, I would still be glad to help out; just may not be quite as"easy" to do.<br>
<br>
Keep up the great work!</div>
