<div class="content">By Stephen Lendman 12-25-13<br>
<br>
How can there be with wars raging out-of control! Who's celebrating while mass slaughter and destruction persist?<br>
<br>
No Christmas cheer this year for billions. No Feliz Navidad. No happy holiday. No Wise Men spreading good will.<br>
<br>
No silent, holy night. No decking the halls. No herald angels singing. None heard on high.<br>
<br>
No coming all ye faithful. No telling it on the mountain. No merry gentlemen resting. No peace on earth coming upon a midnight clear.<br>
<br>
No most wonderful time of the year. No having yourself a merry little Christmas. No holly jolly one. No wishing you one in times of war, injustice and human suffering. Imagine them on an unprecedented scale.<br>
<br>
No frosty the snowman fun. No winter wonderland. No jingle bells joy. No auld lang syne.<br>
<br>
No Christmas 2014 to remember. No Santa on his sleigh. None coming to town. No gifts for billions.<br>
<br>
No peace with war winds raging. None with growing global human misery. America is Scrooge writ large. It's the Grinch that stole Christmas. <br>

<div class="content">I'm not saying it's right, the world being a violent and fubar place.<br>
<br>
But, when Christianity was born. Herod was killing kids and Romans were gathering slaves. So I guess not much has changed.<br>
<br>
So it looks like business as usual, only on a grander scale. <br>
<br>
I'm just glad my parents had the sense to get out of eastern Europe<br>
when they did. Though I hear good things about Poland now where<br>
my Dad was From. Mom being Ukrainian. Wellllll. Kinda always sux there<br>
for the kids living drunk in the sewers in the winter. Besides other things.<br>
<br>
My parents Christmas sucked in WW2 so mine would not suck.<br>
I thank them for that. One of the best Christmas gifts one can give<br>
to someone. The chance to walk freely with ones head held high.<br>
<br>
I feel for the down trodden. I've always backed the longshot/dicriminated against/picked on. But I found out later I have limits. I asked my mom<br>
when I was in the USMC if it would be cool to visit my relatives in Eastern<br>
Europe in the 1980's. Her wise answer to me was,<br>
<br>
"Don't you Dare!" She always knew things about life I was clueless about.<br>
<br>
So Merry Christmas and Happy New Year if ya got the chance to have one.<br>
<br>
Life is short so I prefer to enjoy it since I was given the opportunity and luck to do so. One slip in time and my life would have been way more different.</div>

<div class="content">My father-in-law was so impressed with 'The Land of the Free (TM)' that he spent 17 years of his life sailing the seven seas in a submarine of the imperial navy, enforcing 'peace and democracy', the American way.<br>

<div class="content">Oh yes, and another friend of mine, a young woman from Georgia, spent four months doing hard time, just for protesting at Fort Benning.<br>
<br>
You do know about Fort Benning, home of"The School of the Assassins"? Of course you don't!<br>
<br>
This may enlighten you:<br>

<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The School of the Americas (SOA) is a combat training school for Latin American soldiers, located at Fort Benning, Georgia. In 2001 renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).<br>
<br>
Since 1946, the SOA has trained over 64,000 Latin American soldiers in counterinsurgency techniques, sniper training, commando and psychological warfare, military intelligence and interrogation tactics. These graduates have consistently used their skills to wage a war against their own people. Among those targeted by SOA graduates are educators, union organizers, religious workers, student leaders, and others who work for the rights of the poor. Hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans have been tortured, raped, assassinated, “disappeared,” massacred, and forced into refugee by those trained at the School of Assassins.</div></blockquote>
When I called it"The Imperial Navy", I really do mean"The <strong>Imperial</strong> Navy".<br>
