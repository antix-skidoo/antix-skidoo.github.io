<div class="content">I'm not sure whether this should be posted here or on in Development but it certainly refers to this post (of mine):<br>

and possibly also this one of Rusty's:<br>

Very shortly, the problem I had was that, at the end of November, BT started cabling the village up for fast broadband and, coincidentally, my 64bit Samsung ceased to be able to detect our router on Linux - although it worked fine when I booted into Windows 7. Having said that, it was only 64bit Linux distro's (and I tried several - edit: a lot!) with which this happened. I loaded antiX 32bit and that was also fine. The other machines in the house are all 32bit and didn't experience any trouble.<br>
<br>
BT have now, pretty much, finished. I spent the weekend reformatting the HD and reloading everything and - antiX64, SuSe.12.3 - all is jake.<br>
<br>
So The problem was BT's 4 month line upgrade - though how or why it should have interfered with the connection between the Samsung &amp; the router which were only 12 Ft apart I don,t know? The one thing I have noticed is a huge upsurge in BT connection points within that period:<br>

                    ESSID:"BTOpenzone-B"
</code></pre></div>
and during testing I have connected to at least one (probably more) of them to ensure that the machine hadn't become 'broken' in some way where 64bit Linux was concerned. <br>
<br>
This is less a question, more a cautionary tale. Maybe someone will find it useful - although, I hope, for their sake, not!<br>

<div class="content">I just switched to"Unlimited" and with the new router my mobile phone no longer"sees" the BT wifi signal. Both my computers are connected with an Ethernet cable so they work OK. The Phone used to"see" about three different BT wifi signals. It could be the different frequencies the new routers use.<br>
<br>
I've got a new 64K computer coming next week. I'll let you know if that works.</div>

<div class="content">These kinds of problems - a huge increase in the number of Wifi channels and access points being used in a particular area, can very easily result in Wifi access point channel contention; that is, two, three, or even more, in a tightly congested area, may be generating a sufficiently strong signal to interfere with one another. There are only a finite number of wireless router channels. Inexpensive routers, particularly those that are set to factory defaults with very few changes, are the most likely ones to interfere with one another. For example, in my experience, I have seen a great deal of channel contention and interference between inexpensive Belkin and Netgear (and also Linksys and CISCO) routers, all going for channels 1, 6, and 7 in particular. If you are able to use another channel, for instance, 10, 11, or maybe even 22, those, depending on where you are, may experience less channel interference. Which channels are being used in your areas may vary greatly; the ones in conflict in your area may be different ones. Find out which Wifi access points in your area have the strongest signal, and which channels they are using; program your router to use a different channel and there is a good chance that the problems you see will be either resolved entirely or at least reduced in their frequency; congested Wifi channel signals is a high probability of being the source of this problem, though not necessarily the only thing going on here. Some kernels manage Wifi connections with specific network cards better than others; some experimentation may be necessary there as well. But once I've carved out a Wifi channel that others don't use too often, that usually solves over 95% of wifi connectivity issues for me in my area.<br>
<br>
Making sure my system has the correct wireless firmware associated with my Wifi network takes care of the other problem I've encountered.</div>
