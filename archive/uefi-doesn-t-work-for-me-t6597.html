<div class="content">So I was trying to install antiX onto a laptop I sold a friend. All my hardware is UEFI only as unlike many, I'm a HUGE fan of UEFI, and would never consider using MBR again, so all legacy support is turned off in everything I own. I downloaded and used dd to put the antiX iso on a USB drive. I downloaded the base and full iso via torrent, AND downloaded the base iso via the servers. Tried 3 differnt pc's and 2 different USB's, but NONE of the machines even saw the USB to boot as a UEFI device. Take and throw the Debian netinstall 8.x on them and now it's seen, so obviously not hardware issue. Is there something else you need to do to get antiX iso to be able to boot in full UEFI mode?<br>

Just in case, yes secureboot is turned off, while I love UEFI, not a fan of secureboot.</div>

I also really like the UEFI system. However, I've had zero problem with UEFI. one thing I have done is to disable the"compatibility" mode that my lenovo and my son's dell have, which will boot antiX in legacy mode rather than UEFI.<br>
<br>
You didn't mention which antiX version. I assume antiX 16. You also didn't mention if the laptop in question has a 32bit UEFI, which antiX does still have a problem with, at least on the installer side.</div>

I don't use Windows. That's too bad, I really would have liked to try out antiX, but not willing to download 1 program from outside the repos just to install a single OS. Thanks for the info though, I thought maybe I was going nuts that the front page says it works, but nothing I own recognized it!!<br>

antiX16 &amp; 64-bit, yes. 32-bit UEFI is kinda rare, since when the specs were written it was never intended to be used in a 32-bit environment.</div>

I have no access to Windows (for about 10 years now <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> ) and no installed version of Antix to be able to use antix2usb. Is that just a script? If so, can someone post it please. What about other alternative methods to"dd" ( which I do use most often ). I could use Mint, I think has a script or PCLinuxOS has one?? I guess I am asking what is different or special about the way antix2usb creates the usb stick that the other methods don't do?<br>
<br>
Antix was always my"low resource" alternative to offer/support converts and I would love to offer it again, but at present I can't even boot it on my support machine let alone install it.<br>

I have seen the essence of this solution elsewhere but it is unfortunately not for me. Whilst I could manage it once for me alone, there is no way I could get the remote people I support to go thru something like changing bios modes and boot structures. I have enough trouble explaining"the BIG RED button"?! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
No, I just need the familiar boot from usb and install process of the past. I just cannot figure out what is so different from other distros that I cannot even get the stick recognized? I thought it might be a Debian Jessie thing so I have started looking there in some online sites but no luck as yet.<br>
<br>
Perplexing and frustrating - I really do love Antix but I cannot physically travel to (possibly) hundreds of machines ( lots of Asus &amp; HP) just to do really complex installs.<br>

There's a clue. I will do that later today. See if there is something obvious.<br>
<br>
I think the problem is more what the usb creation script ( or the iso structure itself) does with that info that is different somehow to what the other distros do. As"dd" works for all the other isos, the solution would seem to be in the processes in antix2usb? <br>
<br>
Anyway, I will keep trying.<br>
