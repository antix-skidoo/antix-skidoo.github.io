<div class="content">Kidx, we are really busy now trying to get antiX-13 out the door this weekend. That decision/deadline was made after I started talking with you. I'm kind of tired out but there are a few more things I want to get into the release.<br>
<br>
I can help you with the build tool in about a week.<br>
<br>
The big question is whether or not the state of gaming on Linux will satisfy you or not. This is not something we are equipped to improve. I think 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_gaming"<br>linktext was:"the Wikipedia article"<br>====================================<br>
 is a great place to start. My understanding is that two main ways to play games on Linux is through Steam (which runs natively on Linux) and with Wine. There are probably other good Linux games mentioned in with Wikipedia article.<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amd_linux_april2013&amp;num=1"<br>linktext was:"Here"<br>====================================<br>
 is a recent article on AMD Radeon drivers for gaming on Linux. ISTM we should first see if we can get at least one system (yours) running Linux games to your satisfaction before we start working on making a distro.<br>
<br>
In last few years there have been two different Linux gaming distros. SuperGamer was developed by 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.myspace.com/216167593"<br>linktext was:"Darin Van Coevering"<br>====================================<br>
 but is not readily available. 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://live.linux-gamers.net/"<br>linktext was:"Live.Linux-Gamers"<br>====================================<br>
 is still available but it is a few years old. If you want to make a new Linux gaming distro then you really need to learn from their experience. In particular, you want to know why neither of them is still going. They probably have a ton of other very valuable information.<br>
<br>
I know very little about gaming but IIUC, the Linux gaming situation improved drastically when Steam was ported to Linux in February 2013.<br>
<br>
Again, ISTM the top priority should be to assess the current situation of gaming on Linux and determine if that is satisfactory for you or not. After that, it would be very useful to find out what happened to the previous attempts at gaming distros. Maybe there are some other attempts already underway.<br>
<br>
After this weekend (and, with luck, the antiX-13 release), I have some personal stuff to take care of early next week but I hope to have time for you next Thursday. Maybe this will give you enough to work-on/play-with until then.</div>
