antiX does sound like a good choice for you! It's level of stability and customizeability make it second to none. It is very usable OOTB but also if you want to customize it is very straightforward for most things. Also, the community here and at MepisLovers (a lot of users here are on both forums), provide even more reason to choose antiX. Most are very welcoming and willing to help in any way they can. Welcome to antiX!</div>

<div class="content">My Name in Kevin and I am from Michigan USA..<br>
<br>
I have been using Linux for many years. Started with Redhat 5.0 and Slackware 3.5. I started using Ubuntu starting with 4.10 through 9.10. I mostly use Debian based distros but I have tried most everything. At least once. Tried Mepis and Antixa few years ago. <br>
<br>
Currently I have Ubuntu, ChrunchBang, and XpPro on my main machine. I have an old dell optiplex P-3 450 with 384 megs of ram that I was looking for something to install on it. Looking at Distrowatch I came across AntiX. It looked interesting so I burnt it to cd amd gave it a try. I must say I am very inpressed, I installed it and it runs very well. One of the best distros I have installed on thaat machine.<br>
<br>
It got me think if it runs this good on an old clunker. What would it do on a moderen computer. Well WOW says it all. It runs from the cd faster than Xp or Unbuntu. I belive I have found a replcement for Ubuntu and Chrnchbang.<br>
<br>
Well done everyone.<br>

<div class="content">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I am really new to AntiX. Like I literally, just finished the install to my older laptop, less than 30 minutes ago.<br>
I really like what I have seen so far.<br>
<br>
I have been a Windows user for many years. I bought my first computer from Radio Shack in 1984. My first website on the new Internet in 1992. I made the switch to Linux earlier this year, with Ubuntu 9.04 (Gnome) <br>
<br>
I currently, run LinuxMINT-7 (Main) as my only OS, on my primary PC.<br>
I am a Registered Architect in Santa Fe, NM, USA. So, I am on the computer for most of my day.<br>
I have an older Gateway MX-3210 Laptop, that was on it's last leg; not even XP was installing correctly and it wouldn't connect through WiFi any more.<br>
<br>
I just installed AntiX on it and it went without a hitch. Everything seems to work. The desktop and WM are excellent. I have only used Gnome, and tinkered with KDE, but I like IceWM.<br>
<br>
Great job to whom ever put this OS together.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome to antiX,<br>
<br>
Great distro and the people here are very helpful, antiX runs lean and mean on older rigs, but works extremely well on newer equipment too. TRS-80 or color computer? Yeah, had those also!! Took me a while to find Linux, but now I'd never go back to windows. Again welcome to antix.<br>

<div class="content">Hi All,<br>
My name is Tony and I live in Melbourne, Australia. I just installed MepisAntix to my old computer and it has given it a new lease of life. Have been looking for a while for a lightweight distro that would suit this particular lappy and I finally made it with Antix. Congrats to the developers of Antix.<br>
I run Fedora 11 on my main desktop computer and also my new laptop.<br>
I will be configuring this old laptop for the next few days so that it suits the way I work.<br>
Thanks for the opportunity to give my small story. I used the Linux Format DVD to load Antix.</div>

<div class="content">I've been a sole Linux user since 2008, with only a short-lived, and undedicated Fedora excursion a year or two prior. Before 2008 I had been using Windows 98 SE on PII machine, and grew very tired of an ever slowing, virus-bitten operating system; not to mention constant re-installs, and reboots. When I got a new P4 machine I wanted to change OS, and did not want to go through all the activation balls of XP, so looked again into Linux, where I very quickly settled on Mandriva. I hadn't a DVD writer with the PII, or the very early period of the P4, so had been haphazardly buying and trying out distros bought on Ebay. I remember Knoppix and SimplyMepis had stood out because of the KDE 3 desktop environments, and I had, I think, wanted to go with SimplyMepis, but for reasons I can't remember, wound up using Mandriva 2008.0 instead. Mandriva's KDE 3 was well integrated and configured, with, for me - coming from my dinosaur machine - novelties like video previews, and a control centre; plus, it seems more likely I just brought a willingness I had hitherto not been inclined. <br>
<br>
I am not a disenfrachised Mandriva user however, still favouring it over the other limited distros I have tried (yes, Ubuntu!), and would recommend it for any beginner with a modern PC; I've only just given it up. Trouble is, Mandriva is still a little slow on my P4 machine, no matter which DE I choose, and it was because of this I tried Puppy. Puppy would have me, were it not for my having been spoit by Mandriva's repositories, and the endless .pet forum-scouring. It was on a whim that I tried (fleetingly, and within a day) SimplyMepis, and very soon read about and switched to AntiX.</div>

My P2 IBM 390E is what got me started in AntiX 6. I kept updating it till AntiX 8.2. It ran so good a gentleman who was with his daughter who I was fixing her Laptop (Vista) was so impressed on how well it ran a modern Operating system Wirelessly that he asked,"I'll give ya a $100.00 for it". Sold it 3 days ago. So you should be pleased on how 8.5 will run on that old P2 with a swap Partition and Iceape browser. <br>
<br>
Oh, and I run Puppy also.<br>
<br>
Welcome again to AntiX Stuart.</div>
