<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br>
<br>
The Modem Manager service is not being started.<br>
<br>
I had a look in <em>/</em>etc/init.d/.depend.start and can see that Network Manager is included but not Modem Manager.<br>
<br>
Do I simply need to modify this file to include the Modem Manager? If so, what do I need to add and or modify?<br>
<br>
Or is there some other way that this needs to be done?<br>
<br>
How can I start the service manually?<br>
<br>
Thanks, Michael.</div>

Hi,<br>
<br>
When I tried"sudo service ModemManager start", the following response was received.<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>ModemManager: unrecognized service</code></pre></div>
Is this because there is not a corresponding script in <em>/</em>etc/init.d ?<br>
<br>
There is a ModemManager executable file in /usr/sbin and there is a ModemManager.service file in /lib/systemd/system.<br>
<br>
The NetworkManager service is being started when the system is initialised.<br>
<br>
How do we make the ModemManager service recognised and started when the system is initialised?<br>
<br>
Thanks, MTB.</div>

Hi BitJam,<br>
<br>
I thought that was what was supposed to be happening but I couldn't find where NetworkManager is supposed to initiate ModemManager.<br>
<br>
NetworkManager appears as a process in the Process Viewer (htop) but not ModemManager after the system is started.<br>
<br>
nm-applet is also not being started.<br>
<br>
In /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services are the following files.<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.service<br>
<br>
</span></strong><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># This D-Bus service activation file is only for systemd support since
# an auto-activated NetworkManager would be quite surprising for those people
# who have NM installed but turned off.  Thus the Exec path available to
# D-Bus is /bin/false, but systemd knows the real Exec path due to the NM
# systemd .service file.

[D-BUS Service]
Name=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager
Exec=/bin/false
User=root
SystemdService=dbus-org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.service</code></pre></div>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.service</span></strong><br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># This D-Bus service activation file is only for systemd support since
# an auto-activated ModemManager would be quite surprising for those people

[D-BUS Service]
Name=org.freedesktop.ModemManager1
Exec=/usr/bin/ModemManager
User=root
SystemdService=dbus-org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.service</code></pre></div>
Should the above file be renamed to org.freedesktop.ModemManager.service with the Name parameter changed to"org.freedesktop.ModemManager"?<br>
<br>
I couldn't find any logs to see what is happening when Network Manager is started.<br>
<br>
When the modem is connected to a USB port it is switched (converted) correctly (attached to ttyUSB0, ttyUSB1 and ttyUSB2).<br>
<br>
When I start nm-applet there is no option displayed for"Enable Mobile Broadband" when I right-click on its systray icon.<br>
<br>
antiX-14RAlpha4 is using SysVinit.<br>
<br>
Is there something missing pertaining to SysVinit?<br>
<br>
Thanks, MTB.</div>

Yep<br>
<br>
When I experimented with installing network manager in Antix 14 patch5 version testing. It wanted to pull in systemd libraries.<br>
Which because I was running sysvinit. It said it could not do. I did not post about it because <br>
I had other issues on my IBM T23 posts I was dealing with.<br>

<br>
<br>
So I bailed on the idea of installing network manager in my testing install.<br>
I am actually surprised you got a successful install going with testing repos.<br>
But. It don't sound like it was all the way successful.<br>
I guess you can individually search out each dependency in the link I provided and see if it got installed or not.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br>
<br>
A bit of success to report. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I say a bit because there is still a problem to solve with Network Manager which is outside of my programming capabilities at present and the foreseeable future.<br>
<br>
After further analysis and trial and error based on the above suggestions by Roky and D.O., I was able to determine that the Modem Manager service could be activated by installing the <strong>modem-manager-gui</strong> package and then activating the <strong>Modem Manager GUI</strong> applet from the Applications/System Tools sub-menu.<br>
<br>
Once the Modem Manager service was activated, the Modem Manager GUI applet could be <strong>shut down</strong> (Quit) and the nm-applet could be launched with the <strong>Enable Mobile Broadband</strong> option becoming displayed in the right-click context menu from the systray icon.<br>
<br>
The Modem was also recognised when creating a Mobile Broadband Network Connection.<br>
<br>
However, the password was not being remembered for the Network Connection that I added for the Modem. This was partly solved by installing the <strong>gnome-keyring</strong> package but it appears to only work whilst the session is active. After rebooting, when I <strong>Edit</strong> the Connection and enter the keyring password, when prompted, the Password field for the Network Connection is vacant again. The same issue exists if attempting to activate the connection is your first interaction with the nm-applet. I haven't been able to find a solution for this. Is it a Live environment problem?<br>
<br>
So, it appears that Network Manager has been broken with regards to launching the Modem Manager service. I've since discovered that this may be due to it expecting <em>bloody</em> systemd to be PID 1 which has probably been cause by some systemd moronic proponent or elitist schmuck. This was noted on the associated Debian bugs page 24/11/2014.<br>
<br>
From that bug report, I discovered that executing the command <strong>sudo /usr/sbin/ModemManager</strong> from a Terminal will also activate the Modem Manager service. So, there is no need to install the <strong>modem-manager-gui</strong> package which can't be used for establishing a connection anyway.<br>
<br>
If the Debian Wheezy repository was added to Synaptic and the Network Manager packages etc were downgraded, does anyone think that would provide a more reliable and convenient solution?<br>
<br>
Thanks and hasta pronto, Sherlock <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
