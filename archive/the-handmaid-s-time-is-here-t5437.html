I didn't see anything about the zeitgeist movement on that page. So, to make sure we're on the same channel, the following is what I was referring to. They have some very eye opening documentaries that can be downloaded.<br>

I knew about the events at Waco but had never heard about what had happened in your neighbourhood.<br>
<br>
All these things are interwoven in one way or another more or less.<br>
<br>
I was analytical about things from a young age (about 8 or 9) but it has taken a long time for the pieces to fall into place to be better informed about various things.<br>
<br>
At Sunday School (I should say Sunday Indoctrination), when I was 7 or 8 I was appalled (mortified ?, horrified? and whatever other suitable adjectives could be applied) to read and learn about the"crucifixion of Jesus Christ".<br>
<br>
I can remember discussing the existence of God with my father when I was 11, I think, and of course he had no answer as to where God came from. In the same year, another guy and I caused quite some consternation at school when raising questions about the truth of what is in the bible and the teachings of same during a"Religious Instruction" class. It is unfortunate to see that the schools are still being used as a conduit for religious indoctrination.<br>
<br>
In the same year I think, I was reading a book about King Henry VIII and his 6 wives (unfortunate souls). I can't remember what sparked the conversation or comment but, silently inside, I was astounded that my Father could be proud of having british heritage after I had been reading about the barbaric and injust behaviours of these people.<br>
<br>
It was the same year also, I think, that I really become aware of the ANZACS and the conflicts and horrors they endured at Gallipoli. Knowing what I know now and how all these problems are interwoven makes it all the more sickening.</div>

To begin with Henry VIII was not"British"; he was an"English" monarch of"Welsh" descent. Britian didn't exist until the act of Union when the Scottish King James became the first king of Britain.<br>
<br>
Comparatively Henry VIII was small potatoes. What about the way Charlemagne lined up 4,500 Saxons, ordered them to convert to Christianity and then executed them all? And then people wonder why the Vikings later attacked monstareries, when they were simply defending themselves against the Christian butchers.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Massacre of Verden, Bloodbath of Verden, or Bloody Verdict of Verden (German Blutgericht von Verden) was a massacre of 4,500 captive Saxons in October 782. During the Saxon Wars, the Saxons rebelled against Charlemagne's invasion and subsequent attempts to christianize them from their native Germanic paganism. The massacre is recorded as having occurred in what is now Verden in Lower Saxony, Germany.</div></blockquote>
Of course, then we have the things the Christians did to the American Natives. How many were burned at the stake in order to quench the Chritsian thirst for blood? How could anybody, by your way of thinking, be proud of their Christian heritage?<br>

Thinking about it further, as we humans are incredibly efficient killing machines, how can you be proud of your human heritage? Have you considered becoming a frog, or maybe a butterfly?</div>
