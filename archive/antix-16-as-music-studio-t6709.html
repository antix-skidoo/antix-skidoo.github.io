<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I'm new to antiX, but used linux for over 18 years. Started with Red Hat, then SuSE. Meanwhile I used windows 95, NT and XP as music studio with Cubase. Also used BeOS 4&amp;5 as studio for a while (very fast and excellent quality). This last experience and the way economics changed the studio landscape, made me return to linux.<br>
<br>
First used Corel linux, then ubuntu 10.04 and playing around with Ubuntu Studio 10.<br>
TangoStudio, based on ubuntu 12, was my favourite for years because it was my best music studio I used. But then it got discontinued and Ubuntu was getting heavy to use for my latop (Intel Core2 Duo CPU T5800 @ 2.00GHz 3103MB).<br>
<br>
I've been testing several distro's and builds for almost over a year now and antriX looked promising fast and light.<br>
<br>
The setup was not that smooth. I had to repair and edit grub, re-set language and keyboard, reinstall wicd to get my wireless card working, edit fstab before I could get to my windows disk. And the best studio setup I could create was disappointing with many Xruns (see image) mysteriously disappearing sound.<br>
<br>
I will try it for a few days more and hopefully I can get it right.<br>
<br>
AntiX 16 with fluxbox looks and feels good.</div>

Eino knows a lot about setting up a antix studio version. I shot him a PM to take a look at this thread. In the meantime. I hope you find a solution <span style="text-decoration: underline">in the link I provided</span>. Maybe one of those threads shows any fix you may need. Good luck with it.<br>
<br>
If you look through inxi -r in terminal. You will see AntiX is Debian with added benefits included without systemd. I am not sure if systemd may be requirement for certain applications you use to install properly or not. I am not knowledgeable enough to know this . Being I am not a <br>
a studio application using AntiX user. All I can say is to run the problematic application through a terminal to launch it.<br>
<br>
Then post errors in this thread. Maybe another, more knowledgeable member than me will know how to rid you of that error message. <br>

Happy Trails, Rok.</div>

I'm also no profesional. The music I make is a mix of industrial elements and nature-sounds (most of them are unrecognisable). I don't use instruments, so it's all based on software and a midi keyboard. That's why want my soft studio to be in good shape.

Thanks, Eino's antiX Studio is one of the reasons I wanted to use antiX16. <br>

I knew antiX is Debian and not Ubuntu, that is just another reason. Thanks for the tip of running things through a terminal. Never done this, I was mostly using trial and error methods. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

<div class="content">Wow, you guys really give me hope.<br>
<br>
I'm not terribly new to Linux, but still a newbie. I used Ubuntu Studio for a while, AVLinux and tried FXStudio to no avail. I'm now running the latest Antix on an old Dell Laptop and desktop thanks to the suggestion of a generous soul ( @rokytnji ) on LinuxQuestions, who also turned me onto this forum. I just saw that you are here rokytnji. Thanks!<br>
<br>
I was a journalist until now, not sure if I still am or not... we'll see. But one thing I want to do is to continue doing my podcasts and light film editing of the products I test. I also play music and have an Alesis drum, a few guitars, a keyboard and a few whatnots I'd love to hook into here eventually.<br>
<br>
I need to figure out how to turn this modest old laptop into a fairly usable studio. Eventually, when money comes back, I'll get something beefier.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I have to figure out why the desktop sessions don't remember the settings and a few other inconsistencies I have now. I'm not very proficient with Linux but willing to learn. Apple made me stupid. I can't find my way outside a GUI <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I'm slowly befriending the terminal <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
I'm barely crawling and will walk later before I run.</div>

I have more freedom with the latter. YMMV may vary from mine how ever. Good luck.<br>

Don't limit yourself to just searching and watching AntiX 16 videos. AntiX 13 and under videos are just as relevant in some sections as AntiX 16 is today. Just take it slow and easy.</div>

100% agree. I was a teacher when bleeding edge interactive cd roms came about and switched to computers. The automotive industry is in shambles, now I'm going elsewhere.<br>

I have a lot of questions about Antix and more. I'll start posting them in the right places. Thanks!</div>
