<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
My name is Joe. I live near Ft. Lauderdale, FL, USA. I'm 55 years old. I work from home doing odd-jobs on a website called Amazon Mturk. I am divorced and have two grown children. I like watching"quality" TV shows and movies, reading, watching figure skating, following causes that I believe in on Facebook and working in my yard. <br>
<br>
My computer is a 1st gen Intel Compute Stick with an Atom z3735f quad core processor (1.3 GHz), embedded Intel HD graphics, 1 GB soldered-in RAM and an 8GB eMMC internal drive. I bought it new about a month ago for 45.00 USD.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to be with you.</div>

I've never heard of antiX installed on one of those. How does the base version run? This may be perfect replacement for my media streaming antiX box (still running antiX 15 on that one).</div>

Also it has only an 8GB eMMC internal drive. I bought it about a month ago brand-new for $45.00. They are still available for that price. There are major issues. It can only run with a special version of Ubuntu 14.04 because of proprietary firmware and driver related to the Realtek chip. If you change from that, you lose wifi, bluetooth and HDMI audio. It is very sluggish with that distro. There is a fellow in Australia who made changes to the kernel so that you can upgrade to later versions and flavors of Ubuntu. I used his modified Lubuntu and it worked well. I wanted more flexibility so I bought a USB hub and several dongles to be able to use other distros . My total cost was just over $100. <br>
<br>
It hasn't run so well, unfortunately. It crashes now and then. I just implemented a change to the kernel that limits the processor's power state and that seems to have solved the problem.<br>
<br>
You can get a better 1st gen Intel Compute Stick with 32GB eMMC and 2 GB of RAM for $90.</div>

<div class="content">Howdy and Welcome.<br>
<br>
I'm lucky enough to get old servers from City Hall through my wifes job connections there for free.<br>
Hence larger units that draw more power. But my electric bill in my motorcycle shop is not so bad<br>
running my AntiX media center in there. One is a Emachine 3507. The other is a Dell 755. Stereo is <br>
200 watt per channel amplifier with lot's of speakers. AntiX Media center supplies .pls file stream radio stations. xmms plays them. <br>
<br>
Have fun with AntiX and the forum.</div>
