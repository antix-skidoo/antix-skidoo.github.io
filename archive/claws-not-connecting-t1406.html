<div class="content">Hi, I have Antix 7.5 'Live CD', it comes up well and connects to internet if I run Firefox. I'm happy with Firefox but tried Dillo just to see it, and got a message 'No connection'. That's O.K. I like Firefox. My big problem is Claws mail. It won't connect. I would like to install Antix but I need email and I don't want to download a big program. I believe Claws is derived from Sylpheed. Now a couple of years ago I tried Puppy O.S. and it had Sylpheed and it gave exactly the same trouble. Many questions and answers on the Puppy forum left me without email, so that was the end of Puppy. I hope you can help me. <br>

<div class="content">If you have an internet connection there is no reason for claws not to connect, or dillo for that matter. I would confirm that your connection is stable. If you say Firefox is connected, while loading a page click"get mail" and see what happens. <br>
<br>
The usb&gt;&gt;modem connection you have, is it dial up, high speed, cell????????</div>

<div class="content">Hi, eriefisher. I tried your suggestion of 'get mail' with the same result - No connection. The connection is highspeed - called 'broadband' here in Australia. Tried 'Dillo' again and got 'Unable to connect to remote host' Any other suggestions out there? Could there be some file that needs to be activated, or something like that? <br>

<div class="content">Success. Well, partial success. Your query about USB speed made me think a bit and I went to 'hal-device manager' (I think!) and the info on USB Controllers, etc. didn't seem to include 'Standard' which I believe is an indication of USB 2 ? So I looked at the computer box and it has four USB ports on the back and two on the front. I should say here that it is an old machine, borrowed from a friend who upgraded. And he did say once something about the USB ports being 'different'. So I unplugged from the rear port and inserted the cable in the front instead. Accessed 'Claws' and set it up and, BIngo! I received a couple of messages. Terrific! Then I tried to send and it <strong>was connecting </strong>to the ISP but failed in sending. Several attempts including going from 'Queued messages' all had the same result. So I have left it for now - try again tomorrow. I also tried 'Dillo' but it couldn't connect either. <br>
So I have more work yet but am much happier. If anyone has any more suggestions I'd be very pleased to hear them.<br>
Thank you all for the help so far. Macee.</div>
