<div class="content">At my posts (viewtopic.php?f=49&amp;t=5292 ), I've gotten the advice from Skidoo, BitJam, ... to build Antix 13 from core.<br>
<br>
I initially had the objection that the approach was uncompatible with my initial approach I wanted to follow (simply combining the packages and combining it with a script to add the packages, and also delete packages allready in the base version using rm-commands).<br>
<br>
However, as the amount of changes I now want to do extend beyond simply adding and removing packages, but also include visual changes, ... I decided to switch my tactic. Also, I'm now thinking of possibly also combining the tactic with making additional features (personal server, ...) available via the metapackage manager, while keeping the main respin I want to do more basic, simply focusing on the visual changes, ... first.<br>
<br>
There are however some main questions I still have with this method.<br>
* First of all, what is standardly included in core ? I know it has Ceni and a package manager (I assume this is the synaptic package manager ?) Does it have the control panel though, and all underlying programs in the control panel that are in the base version (ARandR, ...) The control panel has been for me one of the essential parts why I chose Antix and really needs to be present. In addition, how can I add the programs that are in the base version in an easy way (can I simply take over packages from the base distro, i.e. by either plugging in another USB stick with the base version on it, or are the packages all ready ready for install via antix core -present on antix core usb stick-, but simply not yet installed ? If so, what is the command to add these packages from the stick ?<br>
<br>
* When I add OpenBox rather than FluxBox, is that automatically set in the control panel (some parts of the control panel have functions/programs to modify the desktop environment.<br>
<br>
* When I choose not to install any login manager, and only OpenBox (discarding the whole SpaceFM/Fluxbox ) are the settings for this automatically changed, and the options/buttons removed ? I assume they won't be, but then how do I alter this (remove buttons, ...), so the control panel looks sleeker/less confusing ? I also wish to add some programs that are found with openbox, like Openbox configuration manager (obConf), autostart script. I assume the themes also found in SliTaz can be moved over freely btw, that way there are sufficient themes. For the taskbar, I'm thinking of using Adeskbar together with a pager at the top. Adeskbar seems to be the (one of the) lightest docks (-see 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://pclosmag.com/html/Issues/201109/page03.html"<br>linktext was:"http://pclosmag.com/html/Issues/201109/page03.html"<br>====================================<br>
 and Cairo Dock- and probably also better in general than others like SimDock, BBDock, fbpanel, PyPanel, SimDock, Wbar, Avant Window Navigator, Docky, Apwal, Tablaunch, tabble, WMdrawer, ...) See 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Getting_started#Using_Openbox_without_a_desktop_environment_.28The_lightweight_approach.29"<br>linktext was:"http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Getting_st ... pproach.29"<br>====================================<br>
 The dock will come at the bottom, and the pager at the top. If someone has experience with the other docks and found it to be better/more lightweight, let me know (I'm still unsure on whether Apwal or BBDock may be faster than ADeskbar).<br>
For the pager, I think to use OBPager (
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://obpager.sourceforge.net/"<br>linktext was:"http://obpager.sourceforge.net/"<br>====================================<br>
).<br>
For the clock, I'm not sure. Probably the easiest and best will be to use the clock in Adeskbar. Else, if Adeskbar won't be used, either bbtime/bbdate (see 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbtools/files/?source=navbar"<br>linktext was:"http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbtools ... rce=navbar"<br>====================================<br>
 ), lal (
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://projects.l3ib.org/lal/"<br>linktext was:"http://projects.l3ib.org/lal/"<br>====================================<br>
) or the clock in conky can be used.<br>
For the news ticker (CNN headlines, ...), either News RSS ticker (
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.newsrssticker.com/download.php"<br>linktext was:"http://www.newsrssticker.com/download.php"<br>====================================<br>
 ) or perhaps noteo can be used. See 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://bavardage.awardspace.com/noteo/"<br>linktext was:"http://bavardage.awardspace.com/noteo/"<br>====================================<br>
# <br>
<br>
Another thing finally is the antix core version: there doesn't seem to be an antix 13.2 in the core version (see 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://sourceforge.net/projects/antix-linux/files/Final/antiX-13.1/"<br>linktext was:"http://sourceforge.net/projects/antix-l ... ntiX-13.1/"<br>====================================<br>
 ). Can I upgrade antix 13.1 core version to 13.2 some other way (by downloading newer versions of specific packages, ...) <br>
<br>
PS: for the initial start, I'll probably need to type in the following commands after booting the core usb stick:<br>
sudo apt-get install xorg<br>
sudo apt-get install openbox<br>
and then work from there by adding programs via synaptic package manager in X ?</div>

<div class="content">core has some command line apps, the the standard debian commandline apt tools for package management, and a free as in libre kernel. it is really stripped down. the standard antix source lists are included (although now that I think of it, the stable antix.list sources might be out of date)<br>
<br>
there is no x server, no desktop/wm environment, and no non-free firmware. its all commandline. networking tools are present, as a long as your wireless device is totally open source (atheros comes to mind) then wireless will work out of the box. however, its maybe very likely you will need some non-free firmware installed for wireless to work (including intel wireless). ethenet networking works pretty good though, and ceni will help you manage all of that.<br>
<br>
smxi is available as well, which is a script based system for installing different packages. its pretty extensive and helps with video drivers especially.<br>
<br>
If you want a sneak peak of what you are checking out, check out my video series on antiX core, including command line package management, kernel installation, and installing a desktop environment. There are lists of steps and packages in the notes beneath each video on what is seen in the vid. obviously you'll want different apps, but the vids will give you an idea of the steps involved. <br>

<div class="content">I would suggest taking a look at smxi, which iIrc, is in core. there is no synaptic, but it is just an apt-get away, I have not seen an antixcc in core, but I am not sure, You need xinit to start your x . I believe a theme is a theme, so it can probably be moved over. <br>

If you are going to use a script to add and remove stuff, make the script use apt?</div>

* Rereading your post, I indeed saw you never said I best used the core version. However, you did motivate me (in your first message to me at Thu Oct 02, 2014 8:03 pm ) to start work on the project myself, rather than relying on cooperating with others to get this done. My intitial intent was to basically just come up with the required changes (benefitting everyone using the distro) without executing the changes myself, but I now see that probably won't be accepted, and will myself really need to work on execution as well.<br>

It's starting to bug me that I always need to explain this, and once the subject of payment is raised, people at linux distro forums start to look at me as being some sort of profiteer or someone that's trying to scam people on other people's work. That's really not the truth, rather it's the opposite, I'm trying to make linux bigger and just make sure development keeps ongoing due to some form of financial motivation for the developers (which isn't me btw, it would have been the developers of the main distro and/or the respin I propose; see the bodhi forum posts at 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://forums.bodhilinux.com/index.php?/topic/11204-suggestions-on-how-to-improve-bodhi-linux-flavours/"<br>linktext was:"http://forums.bodhilinux.com/index.php? ... -flavours/"<br>====================================<br>
 ) The ThinkPenguin cooperation was an idea btw that would hook into this, it might increase funding for the AntiX/respin development, and they also only work with FOSS hardware, so it's more compatible with most linux distros/gives less problems. Also, they too would have increased knowledge of the antix distro/respin, further benefitting the free software movement.<br>
<br>
Then for the"bouncing all over the map" comment:<br>
It is true that I changed my approach a few times, I am indeed still figuring things out; I don't often drastically/radically change my approach though. Regarding XAMPP: I mentioned XAMPP and AMPPS in the beginning but later also mentioned PirateBox (which contains lighttpd, ...) I haven't tried either yet so am not yet fully sure what the best one will be. Once I tried both, I'll pick one and integrate it; the project is only just starting, so please give me some manouvring room. Also for the Fluxbox, and OpenBox comments: I first mentioned to just use FluxBox since that's all ready integrated in Antix Base. After having been playing around with different distro's though, I found OpenBox to be a bit better since it has more configuration options (including screen corner adjustment, programs to autostart, and the ability to remove minimise and maximise buttons, ...). Also, when swapping to using the core version, fluxbox won't be integrated by default, so there's no longer a need to delete/replace that (no extra work).<br>
<br>
Aeprojects.tk finally isn't made by me; it belongs to George Pearson's 2nd chance network (
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://secondchancenetwork.eu.pn/"<br>linktext was:"http://secondchancenetwork.eu.pn/"<br>====================================<br>
 ). George initially asked me about whether I wanted to help out with making a distro that has the aeprojects.tk content in it. I'm not an expert in all this myself neither, but I have some time left and decided to accept. If you start researching the OTGL site btw, you'll see that George had the

 on there well before I started on this project. Also, that item was about a Lightweight Personal Security or SliTaz distro, not Antix. George mentioned the Slitaz distro to me, and I too liked it, so that's also why I mentioned it a few times. Still, I found Antix to be ultimately better than SliTaz.</div>

I am not the crispist cookie in the jar. The sharpest pencil in the cup. But I have eyes and can read and think for myself.<br>
If want something. You will never see me post about about wanting somebody else to aquire what I want and give it to me.<br>
I will read. Research. Do what I want. If it goes south. I will then post on exactly what I am running.<br>
What I have done. Any error messages. You know. Just the facts, Jack.<br>
<br>
And before I will even post then. I will read my error messages and do searches on what they mean. Because I am not the sharpest<br>
pencil in the cup. Just a scooter tramp.<br>
<br>
All this airy fairy stuff just bores me too tears. But some folks get off on this I guess.</div>

<div class="content">You're all echoing my concerns at the outset. Ultimately Brian you need to go away and either a) do this yourself or b) give up. I don't think you can do a) which makes b) all the more appropriate. The is no lack of willingness at the forum to help, I can talk from personal experience. However, as you can see there is an inertia when someone rocks up and want people to do something for them. You seem to have a half baked idea in you head for the design of twin USB stick server that no one would ever want or use here or in the developing world. I don't mind that and if you wanted or needed help with your project I and others would offer as much guidance as we could. However, you want us to do the actually work and modify all the code for you...for a project which you do not fully understand or have the requisite skill set to either take part in or manage. <br>
<br>
You're not listening - a tiny server than runs on a USB stick has no convincing use case. Neither the size nor the portability are useful and valuable design parameters for a server. Indeed a miniscule size, less than that of a DVD, is not even necessary when the cheap USB drive cost no money whatsoever."Why can't I get on the server?" if the answer is"He's not here with the USB stick," or"Someone stole the USB stick," what is the value this solution?<br>
<br>
If you're asking what does Core contain package wise, you demonstrate an inability to research answers yourself, or an inability to understand the readily available information. If you're asking does Core ship with Synaptic then you clear do not understand what X is and have no business trying to project manage a USB server design.<br>
<br>
You're out of your depth, you don't know that what you're trying to do is redundant. For that reason you need to desist.</div>

 <div class="content">In this post (and in many others), it appears that someone forgot to do his/her research ahead of time. I ain't the brightest lightbulb in the box, but I can learn. Asking the question first to yourself, and then looking for the answers online from places like Google, Alta Vista, or Bing will at least give you an idea of what is involved. Asking someone to give you an answer for a GENERAL question is silly. Now asking for a SPECIFIC answer to a question is different. And those are the ones we try to solve here.<br>
<br>
Lots of times I have seen people ask a question that 15 minutes on Google gave me the answers."How much will it cost me to put a 502 Cubic inches Chevrolet engine on a Harley Davidson frame?" is a question you can search for online. Look in other forums about what others have done, and what it costs them.<br>
<br>
Because of my head injury a few years back, I have forgotten more than what some people learn in a lifetime. Now i have trouble remembering what I had for breakfast. But one thing I did remember. Use as many resources to search for an answer BEFORE asking someone about it.</div>

<div class="content">I am a fan of Linux (and a seasoned IT professional) and been using the OS much more than Windows for my daily tasks and when an issue pops up I look to see if there's anyone who has had a similar issue and see if there's a solution. Otherwise I'll ask my question and wait for a *sane* response as trolls and dumbwits I just pass over. To me if no one can offer a good solution to the issue at hand, but babble about unrelated BS, just don't post in the thread as it will only start flamewars and pissing matches which are not helpful at all.<br>
<br>
Sorry if I came off harsh but seeing many threads (even the ones not started by me) get derailed with pettiness just bugs me (and it should with the other regulars here).</div>
