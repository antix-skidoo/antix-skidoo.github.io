<div class="content">I want to completely remove icewm, jwm and fluxbox packages from antiX 16.2. If I do a complete removal from synaptic the packages get removed. However when I add a new package - with synaptic or apt-get install - at the end of the install I still get"Writing Menu: icewm". Also for jwm and fluxbox. So my guess is that there are still remnants of the removed packages.<br>
<br>
The reason I want a complete removal is that I want to install openbox with fbpanel menus generated by obmenu-generator. I then get a few duplicate entries in the menu which I suspect comes from the remnants of the icewm, jwm and fluxbox packages. I want to follow the information on lxlinux.com.<br>
<br>
I also want to switch to testing mode and I know of no other Debian distro that does not use systemd. (My aging Intel motherboard gives me major grief if I try for instance sparkylinux.)</div>

<div class="content">I have previously successfully built a distro with antiX-core but the long time building it further was not to my liking. I like what antiX gives me, but not icewm and jwm. fluxbox I can live with if I must.<br>

Would removing the desktops harm antiX? Otherwise I can just leave them be and try and bypass duplicate menu entries.</div>

i believe these are remnants of debians menu updater, not icewm actually. someone please correct if this is false. in fact i dont believe this is related to antix at all (rather debian again,) but i could be wrong about that as well.</div>

Yes, please test across distros. I expect you'll discover the"obmenu-generator quirks" are inherent, are not distro-specific.<br>
Well, they are not specific to one particular debian-based distro.<br>

@skidoo I'll further investigate fbpanel and obmenu-generator.<br>

Debian and no systemd _and_ testing or sid mode?<br>

well that aint right... as a born southerner i always leave a network port open for the king. password is"uh-huh?" though youll never guess which port!<br>

that said, im going to stay far away from fbpanel. at this rate even the framebuffer will be phoning home, followed by nano and the kernel itself.</div>

plus mine. i believe she includes every refracta derivative except mine, as some kind of way to be annoying and petty and dishonest. if refracta wasnt such a high-quality, reliable thing (for me that is,) i would find something else over that.<br>
<br>
i am on better terms with the actual refracta lead developer, though i wouldnt recommend dev1galaxy if i were paid handsomely to do so. too many rabid fanboys in devuan already. still not as bad as debian. right, off-topic. sorry, i enjoy cults is what i meant. theyre so welcoming. please DO visit dev1galaxy, youll like it really its nice.</div>

So systemd is is disabled as per Debian's instructions but it seems that all the underlying systemd dependencies remain intact which means that there is quite a big difference between what MX and Devuan are doing. Not sure if antix goes further . . .</div></blockquote>Is she really that unenlightened? Does she really believe"MX has systemd inside?"<br>
Hard to believe, considering her frequent participation in topics at debian forum, alongside MX's Stevo.<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt the sincerity of her FUD-like remark"Not sure if antix goes further . . ."<br>
Said differently: I'm reasonably certain she knows full frickin well that antiX is systemd-free; so, the"dishonest" shoe fits her.</div>

<div class="content">weve been entertained/tolerated this far in critiquing another forum admin, though in my case im bitter-- i thought this was a friend of mine for a few months, long before that forum was established. i think i was treated poorly both for a friend and a forum participant-- <br>
<br>
i have to say that she is not the most tech-savvy person; that i have known tech-savvy and unsavvy people all my life, of every gender, and that hers is a case where she will not understand for example-- that a particular distro is 90+% refracta but with a modified squashfs file, and instead judge based on the name and the boot screen that it might not be"devuan enough." from then on, instead of learning she will lean entirely on what she thinks she knows. its not the lack of facts but the insistence upon it that hurts things.<br>
<br>
thats an example where shes actually making a claim that shes a personal friend-- albeit one that is trying to teach me the importance of things i know to be unbased in fact, even when someone else with an authoritative position is trying to tell her"this is what he says it is." <br>
<br>
with regards to an entirely"foreign" distro, like antix-- where she hasnt the first idea what it is, how it becomes systemd-free, or how to compare how systemd-free it is to devuan or refracta... its entirely fair to say that shes going to simply lean on the authority that shes running something and thinks whatever she does. <br>
<br>
id personally rather deal with the debian mailing list. you may have more luck, but it will be entirely arbitrary and based on personal feelings; not facts, which there is an immunity to. <br>
<br>
and i wont mention it again because we havent gotten a talking to yet. but that was my experience; i *was* donating time, money and other things to the devuan community. i want them to succeed for obvious reasons, but most of them have spent all of my good will. not fsmithred, hes always alright by me. anything ive done for him, no regrets-- i benefit from what he does every single day and there arent nearly enough people like him.</div>

its entirely true, and one of the things ive played with in fig os is"what happens when we get rid of some or all of what *sys*d or *.service* files are left?"<br>
<br>
now i base it on refracta, but ive already made an antix version for fun.<br>
<br>
what happens is, things stop working. in both refracta, (and devuan) and antix. atril stops working and i have to go back to evince. the udisks --dump command stops working until i uninstall and reinstall it, restoring the necessary files i removed from refracta.<br>
<br>
NO DISTRO** works entirely systemd free, depending on what you mean by"systemd free."<br>
<br>
in some regards, i suspect that antix is MORE free of it-- but that the whole point of devuan was to make it sustainably (more easily/automated) free of it. at this point im at a loss to figure out whats keeping it moving so slowly, but i still benefit from their work, whatever it is.<br>
<br>
**i mean ok, some are based on the 2.4 kernel and-- you know what i mean.</div>
