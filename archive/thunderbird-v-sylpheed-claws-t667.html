<div class="content">Does anyone here have any direct comparison knowledge of Thunderbird/IceDove versus Claws mail? (Is it faster, lighter, many features or not etc)<br>
<br>
I've been using Thunderbird for ages, and now using IceDove in antiX, and it's good. I like the way that it works &amp; i like the features etc, but Claws looks pretty good, and LOOKS a lot lighter than IceDove. <br>
<br>
Is it worth it, or would the benefits be minimal?</div>

<div class="content">I like Claws Mail (formerly Sylpheed-Claws) a <em>lot</em> more than Thunderbird. At least on my computer, there is a large difference in performance between the two programs. Even though I have Thunderbird installed, I rarely use it. I mainly keep it around for when I want to send someone a pretty, HTML-formatted,"e-card" type of message.<br>

<div class="content">Hey pcalvert, thanks for the reply. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
I'm still using IceDove (Still haven't changed to claws yet) and i guess one way to lighten the load of IceDove would be to clear out (archive) a lot of the older messages etc (of which there are quite a few). But i still feel that, like Firefox/IceWeasel etc, IceDove is getting somewhat"Heavy" as it matures &amp; progresses, and getting slower as well. That's why i'm considering the change, although it's not something that i'm looking forward to, mainly because, for one thing, i'll have to convert (somehow) the address books from IceDove to claws. Then there's the archiving of all the messages..... (Groan!) <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I'll probably never need them or read them again, but you can bet that if i don't save them somewhere, i'll need"some" of them at some future time! LOL! <br>
<br>
So i take it that claws doesn't do HTML mail then? No biggie i suppose. I'm quite getting into lighter apps at the moment and have started using both kazehakase &amp; midori instead of IceWeasel. They're not as"Featured" but they're a lot quicker &amp; midori is really coming along in leaps &amp; bounds.<br>
<br>
Anyway, many thanks again for the reply. I shall definitely look into claws asap.</div>

Thanks for the link JawsThemeSwimming428. I'm not really into text based apps (i'd rather use xchat than irssi for instance) but it's always good to have alternatives, because you never know when you may need an app like that. I have used links2 on quite a few occassions for instance, when i needed a browser to work on severely restricted (resources wise) machines. I think then, they really shine. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

Claws Mail should be able to easily import your emails from IceDove. You should also be able to import your address book. <br>

&gt; Prior to Claws, I used Thunderbird; through no fault of Claws, I am unable to<br>
&gt; access Thunderbird's address book, thus the harvest tool is crucial.<br>
<br>
Why don't you just export your addressbook from Thunderbird, and import it<br>
again in Claws Mail? Claws Mail has a script to import csv files generated by<br>
Thunderbird (

That's right, Claws Mail doesn't do HTML. However, if you receive an HTML-formatted email message, you can have Claws Mail open the text/html part in a web browser. I just tried it using Dillo as the web browser and it worked okay.<br>
