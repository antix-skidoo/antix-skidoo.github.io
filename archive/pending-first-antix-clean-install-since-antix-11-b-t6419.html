<div class="content">I'm a multi-boot kind of guy. Both my laptop and my desktop generally have three different Linux distros installed {and configured suit to my needs and tastes} But my vererable old mono-processor desktop has just been replaced by a former Win7 HP Pavilion. So I've begun the new installation from current iso downloads of three Linux distros. I was happy with the way rolling release worked with the old antix 11 installation. So I'm about to download and install some antiX version. I notice that there are release specific forums for both 'antiX-15 Killah P' &amp; 'antiX MX-15 Fusion'. I'm not sure which would be a better fit for me...<br>
<br>
But as I recall my old antiX 11's default sources list was heavily commented with instruction on what to comment out and what to uncomment, to make it update as a rolling release. {was it really that simple?} Is either antiX-11 or MX-11 {better/easier/"more reliable"} as a long term rolling release???<br>
<br>
I should probably mention that I don't normally use a DE such as kde or gnome (though I do use applications from several DE projects. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I do like to have lxde or better yet lxqt installed as a back up to a bare openbox session {with a highly customised configuration}.<br>
<br>
I saw something somewhere about putting antix on a bootable flashdrive that interested me.<br>
I think I saw a post on the boards somewhere that indicated it was even possible to completely avoid systemd. That too, interested me.<br>
<br>
Do either of those work better on which release of antiX???</div>

Do BOTH antiX 15 and MX 15 use debian testing to effect a rolling release? <br>

with a little work, yes. I'm not sure about the .xinitrc stuff. you could start lxpanel in our home-grown desktop-session startup file, which maintains startup entries for any of the window managers currently installed on antiX, and I assume it will work once your openbox window manager is installed and set up to work with the display manager (slim in this case)<br>

the live tools are powerful for sure.</div>

<div class="content">jtwdyp, the provided tools in antiX and in MX are very flexible.<br>
Unless your PC cannot boot from USB pendrive, you can skip the step"create a CD from the iso".<br>
You can boot the liveUSB, setup persistence, make your customizations and:<br>
If you wish, install to HDD from the pendrive. Your customizations will be carried over to the HDD install.<br>
If you wish, use the live-remaster tool during a liveUSB session, to create one/various customized bootable pendrives.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I just checked my laptop where it's still a functional rolling release... I don't know, maybe it wasn't called an MX version. <br>
Mepis 11</div></blockquote>Your best source of info/advice for that older Mepis version would be the forum at mepiscommunity.org<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>you could start lxpanel in our home-grown desktop-session startup file, which maintains startup entries for any of the window managers currently installed on antiX, <br>
and I assume it will work once your openbox window manager is installed and set up to work with the display manager (slim in this case)</div></blockquote>jtwdyp, search these forums for"openbox".<br>
Last September or so, someone bent on"keeping OB, just like my crunchybang..." did that: added openbox (and lightDM) to an antix15 system.<br>
IIRC, nope, the antix-menu-manager doesn't autocreate openbox desktop menu entries. <br>
You'll be resigned to hand-editing (obmenuconf utility?) your openbox menu each time you remove or install additional applications.<br>
<br>
What feature(s), what benefit, does openbox provide which fluxbox lacks?<br>
FWIW, that's a pointed question. I'm not aware of any significant benefits.<br>
I don't pay attention to stuff like"can rearrange order of titlebar max/minimiz/close buttons".<br>
Maybe openbox natively provides compositing/transparency (fluxbox does not) and that feature is important to you?<br>
<br>
jtwdyp, it's probably easier/quicker to DO than it is explain or read someone's explanation.<br>
Try it:<br>
within an antiX live session (preferably a live + semi-automatic persistence boot session):<br>
1) install lxpanel<br>
2) desktop menu --} controlCentre --} Session --}"edit fluxbox files"<br>
3) outcomment fbpanel in <strong>fluxbox</strong> session-startup config and insert a line to start lxpanel instead<br>
4) logout from your desktop session<br>
<br>
Immediately afterward, when you login to a fluxbox session (any of these in slim menu:"Fluxbox","Rox-fluxbox","Space-fluxbox")<br>
maybe you'll have lxpanel as part of your environment, along with the benefit of automated desktop menu management.<br>
If not, (I can't recall: does access to lxpanel configuration require presence of openbox? That's why I suggested searching prior forum posts)<br>
you can discard the changes at shutdown (if semi-automatic persistence is in effect) or continue experimenting by additionally installing openbox.</div>

<div class="content">I hope that I left the correct citation in here; I knocked out a lot of stuff to address just a couple of things:<br>
<br>
1. re. the reference to Puppy: Both antiX and the current generation of MX owe at least some of the persistence functionality to work that has been experimented and honed over the years in Puppy, (and undoubtedly experimented with elsewhere as well, including in antiX and to some extent in MX). Both antiX and MX have definite benefits: antiX is one of the top platforms to use in order to customize a system to suit yourself.<br>
<br>
2. MX actually comes from antiX, but is specialized to work with a stable version of Xfce, so MX is tied only to stable repositories, whereas you can use antiX with any Debian repo {stable,testing,unstable}. (MX is an Xfce stable replacement for MEPIS 11 - since MEPIS 12 stalled and was never released). Obviously"Stable" is the most likely to have 100% predictable behavior, but with care (and a moderate amount of knowledge) it's possible to build a pretty usable and moderately current system with any of them. Throw in"backports" with Stable to get newer versions of specific applications against a reliable, relatively unchanging base system, and you can get a really nice combination of a rock solid system, very few changes and maintenance, except on any programs you may want to keep more current (browsers are the most common example).<br>
<br>
3. The repo listing that you provide updates only Debian Testing binaries plus Opera. With this, you'd typically be able to keep most screens and menus from an old system, such as MEPIS 11, but in reality you're running Debian Testing with a MEPIS 11 display (or antiX 11, or whatever distribution you started with). Does that make sense?<br>

Well on my laptop and my former desktop I chose antiX as my debian based distro because<br>
it was billed as a rolling release. {I really hate recreating my user environment<br>
every time there's a new release} I won't claim I used it every day. But it was<br>
dependable. And almost painless to keep updated. So if MX-15 is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">jessie/stable only</span></strong><br>
Then I'll start with antiX-15... And if I can dump systemd in the process, I just<br>
might use it more often...

I am perhaps a bit stubborn. I absolutely despise gui boot screens I use a text based<br>
grub menu, and I boot to what used to be called runlevel 3 and run startx if/when I'm<br>
ready for the gui. {Though admittedly about 95% of the time, startx is my first user command.}<br>
I use my own wrapper script to select which window manager or desktop environment I want to<br>
start. Which basically copies a a file like my ~/xinitrc-obox or ~/xinitrc-lxqt to ~/.xinitrc <br>
just before it calls startx.<br>
<br>
I type:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>$ xdo q
</code></pre></div>
if I want lxqt to start, and openbox is even easier because if there isn't any<br>
argument to xdo on the command line, it will use the ~/xinitrc-obox file... <br>
<br>
I'm glad to hear that the slim DM is still there. Especially if I can dump systemd...<br>
I presume that would mean system V. And the last time I set up a debian System V<br>
system to boot to runlevel 3, slim was one of very few Display Managers that<br>
respected update-rc.d start/stop settings. So once slim was selected as a display<br>
manager, all I had to do was:<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>update-rc.d -f slim remove
update-rc.d slim stop 20 2 3 4 5 .
</code></pre></div>
With a systemd system, I'd have to change the: default.target symlink to point at the: multi-user.target</div>

Yeah, I noticed that dolphin_oracle said something about unetbootin... My Mageia<br>
system has a similar tool called isodumper, but there may be an issue, THEIR download<br>
page says all of their isos are compatible with flash drive installs, but cautions<br>
against using unetbootin. So if the antiX iso wants unetbootin, I'm not sure<br>
isodumper will work for it. I know it didn't work for my opensuse installation. But<br>
blank dvd's are cheap, and I've got a package of 50 just sitting there, collecting dust.<br>
<br>
But wait a minute let me check... YUP UNetbootin is available on opensuse so I just<br>
did an:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>zypper in unetbootin
</code></pre></div>
And now have the right tool to put antiX iso on a flash drive. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div> You can boot the liveUSB, setup persistence, make your customizations and:<br>
If you wish, install to HDD from the pendrive. Your customizations will be carried over to the HDD install.<br>
If you wish, use the live-remaster tool during a liveUSB session, to create one/various customized bootable pendrives.</div></blockquote>
I presume the liveusb has easy to follow instructions to do those things on it.<br>
especially the"setup persistence" part so that any work I put into customizing it<br>
will carry over to my eventual hard drive install...<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>jtwdyp, search these forums for"openbox".<br>
Last September or so, someone bent on"keeping OB, just like my crunchybang..." did that: added openbox (and lightDM) to an antix15 system.</div></blockquote>
Thank you! If I'm unable to disable the use of a display manager {see above} I will<br>
hunt that thread down.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>IIRC, nope, the antix-menu-manager doesn't autocreate openbox desktop menu entries. <br>
You'll be resigned to hand-editing (obmenuconf utility?) your openbox menu each time you remove or install additional applications.</div></blockquote>
Yeah, well I'm kind of used to that. Opensuse does a good job with the openbox menu.<br>
But on most of the systems I've used it on, the menu is kind of static and not very<br>
good for finding new applications. But I start most things from the command line or<br>
with keybindings anyway. And one of the reasons I add lxpanel to my openbox session<br>
is that unlike openbox's menu, lxpanel's embedded menu is usually automatically updated. <br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What feature(s), what benefit, does openbox provide which fluxbox lacks?<br>
FWIW, that's a pointed question. I'm not aware of any significant benefits.<br>
I don't pay attention to stuff like"can rearrange order of titlebar max/minimiz/close buttons".<br>
Maybe openbox natively provides compositing/transparency (fluxbox does not) and that feature is important to you?</div></blockquote>
I'm a very keyboard centric user. I don't have the right kind of dexterity to use a<br>
mouse well. But even from a virtual console I can put a copy of of my existing file<br>
in any distribution's ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml. And assuming the same applications are<br>
installed, my keybindings will work from the get go. I organize around my 12"desktop<br>
areas" some of which have a dedicated purpose. For example I open anything related to<br>
email or newsgroups in the one called with &lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;F2&gt; &lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;F12&gt; is where I'd open a<br>
root konsole {though I'd run a system upgrade from a virtual console... only had to have<br>
X crash in the middle of an upgrade once...}<br>
<br>
My fingers know which keybinding to use to get to the right desktop area, each of<br>
which has a separate background image. So if I fat fingered &lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;F3&gt; instead of<br>
&lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;F2&gt; I'd notice before I opened a second instance of my alpine mailclint...<br>
<br>
A <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">LONG time ago</span></strong> I liked kde3 But that changed when they dumped kde4 on me.<br>
the dev's wanted to make me use my computer their way, instead of mine... Wasn't gonna happen!<br>
<br>
I tried enlightenment. And for a while was happy with E16. But E17 changed the<br>
keybinding settings to a mouse intensive gui edit, and then every couple months<br>
they'd change something that would trash my old keybindings and make me fight with<br>
the mouse all day to put my keybindings back in... That all changed when I learned to<br>
edit my own ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml. And learned to use a script initialized in my<br>
~/.config/openbox/autostart, that uses qiv or feh and xprop to set the right<br>
background image every time I change desktop area's. My user environment stays stable,<br>
my keybindings stay stable, and most of the time my {expletive deleted} mouse can sit<br>
by the phone, collecting dust. And the best part is that {so far} nobody messes with<br>
openbox's comfortable user designed user interface.<br>
<br>
Alternatively I like lxqt better than lxde or xfce, But I can work with any of those<br>
long enough to get my openbox settings up and running... Then I kind of forget their<br>
there...</div>

<br>
Good. Cause Puppy did that stuff right. But to have access to anything in debian<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>3. The repo listing that you provide updates only Debian Testing binaries plus Opera. With this, you'd typically be able to keep most screens and menus from an old system, such as MEPIS 11, but in reality you're running Debian Testing with a MEPIS 11 display (or antiX 11, or whatever distribution you started with). Does that make sense? </div></blockquote>
Does to me... In any case, Ill be downloading an antiX-15 iso shortly...<br>

I'd like to thank you all for the helpful responses. They made it easy to decide what<br>

What the heck is a"mouse well"? Bet you made that up and are just pulling my leg.<br>

I got too few brain cells to dedicate any toward memorizing keybinds.<br>
Sometimes, in between watching cat videos and running to the store to buy lottery tickets, I do manage to memorize a few keybinds but I just wind up forgetting 'em overnight and have to start all over again.</div>

I guess he is saying he can not use"it" (the mouse)" well". (in a good way).<br>
<br>
<br>
Either that, or a mouse well would be an old style mouse trap, where the mouse falls into a bucket (well), and can not get out?<br>
<br>
I have problems using those too. same with the glue traps. It just seems like a mean way to treat animals.</div>

<div class="content">I've been around since the days of General Electric ASR 33 Teletype devices with paper tape readers and mainframe systems with punch cards, followed by display terminals with white, amber, or green text, so I can get around the keyboard fluently as well.<br>
<br>
Back when I did a lot of development script work and software kit building, I had short commands, one, two, or three character alias entries for the most commonly used commands, and function keys mapped to many common commands. I also had multiple text editors with multiple custom interfaces so that I could use them interchangeably across diverse systems. Along that line, I had commands and aliases to access many different systems across not only my team's subnet, but across any systems that supported or interacted with the activities I worked on.<br>
<br>
As GUI-based systems became more prevalent, I created a mix of capabilities that allowed me to take advantage of both console commands and one or two click systems. Any system requiring a lot of clicks was something I either found an"accelerator" for, or something I avoided if possible.<br>
<br>
But like so many other things, times changed, the companies and systems I used changed, and it became more and more difficult to bring my toolchest of commands along with me, so I adapted. I understand and appreciate both the"old way" of doing things and the current generation. Each has their features, benefits and constraints. The more of them I know, the more flexible I can be to meet my next work challenge. I do keep my old bag of tricks on a few of my personal systems to this day.<br>

<div class="content">Just to be clear, when I say I can't use a mouse {AKA Rodent AKA Rat} pointing device well, I mean:<br>
<br>
A) If I tried to close Iceweasel by clicking on the little x in the corner, Then unless I slow down so much that it would be quicker for me to type the entire first line of this post, I'm just as likely to accidentally maximize it instead. <br>
<br>
B) if I use a mouse {non stop} for 15 minutes my carpel tunnel kicks in enough to make my hand go numb.: Just like it does when I try to write on paper for that long. The odd thing is I can keyboard for hours without the same problem. (That's not to say I type quickly, I have to see the keys to type). I do somewhat better with a well designed trackball. But not enough better to make much difference.<br>
<br>
C) On my dell laptop I need to disable the touch pad while typing or I'll accidentally change the focus of what I'm typing into. Which is very bad because I'm too busy looking at the keyboard to notice what's happening on the screen till I'm done typing something.<br>
<br>
That's why I like openbox. It took me a long time to learn to make it work my way. But at least my keybindings are as portable as my:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code> ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml
