<div class="content">According to the US Constitution, the only"lands" the Federal government is allowed to own must be recognized and addressed by Congress. If Congress would have refused to recognize Teddy Roosevelt's want for a National Park, then that land would never have become one. Also, these are all PUBLIC LANDS, for use by the PUBLIC, which are"We the People".<br>
<br>
What has been at stake here in Oregon (as well as in Nevada) is land usage. Families have been using certain areas for grazing for several generations, and suddenly the government tells them they do not have the right to use the land. And that they have to pay taxes to use that land. But if they pay the taxes, then they have to pay a fine for all the previous years they used the land without paying the taxes. The armed protesters in Nevada only came AFTER the Federal government sent in armed troops. If it was good enough for them, then the protesters intended to protect themselves.<br>
<br>
An example would go as follows: You own some property and have a dirt road on your property that goes from a state road to your house. Suddenly the Federal government decided to blacktop your dirt road, and wants you to pay a tax to use that road. And if you recognize that you have to pay the tax for the road, then you will be taxed from the day the dirt road was first built.<br>
<br>
This is neither fair or makes much sense.</div>

<div class="content"><em><strong>America’s Shadow Government</strong><br>
<br>
“I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.” —Thomas Jefferson<br>
America's next president will inherit more than a financial catastrophe when he assumes office. He will also inherit a shadow government.<br>
America is under the control of an “invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people and this invisible government is the true ruling power in our country.<br>
“Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve Board, a Government board, has cheated the Government of the United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the national debt…Mr. Chairman, when the Federal Reserve act was passed, the people of the United States did not perceive that a world system was being set up here… and that this country was to supply financial power to an international superstate — a superstate controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure.” – Congressman Louis T. McFadden, from a speech 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.afn.org/%7Egovern/mcfadden_speech_1932.html"<br>linktext was:"delivered to the House of Representatives on June 10, 1932"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
“Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.”— Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President of the United States<br>
“A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is privately concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men… We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated, governments in the civilized world—no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men.” – Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States.<br>
<br>
“The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation… The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties, … and control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country. They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government. It operates under cover of a self-created screen [and] seizes our executive officers, legislative bodies, schools, courts, newspapers and every agency created for the public protection.” – New York City Mayor John F. Hylan,

<br>
“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country… We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” – Edward Bernays (“the father of public relations”), Propaganda, 1928 (note that Bernays’ book, Propaganda, begins with the above quote).<br>
“Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means…We have a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state… It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government… This ruthless power-seeking elite is a disease of our century… This group…is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable.” – Senator William Jenner,

<br>
“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.” – Dwight D. Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States,, 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/%7Ehst306/documents/indust.html"<br>linktext was:"January 1961 Speech"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
“The individual is handicapped by coming face-to-face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. The American mind simply has not come to a realization of the evil which has been introduced into our midst. It rejects even the assumption that human creatures could espouse a philosophy which must ultimately destroy all that is good and decent.” —J. Edgar Hoover<br>
“The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings… Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe… no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of “clear and present danger,” then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent… For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.” — John F Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, from a speech delivered to the American Newspaper Publishers Association on April 27, 1961 and

 before the American Newspaper Publishers Association at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.<br>
<br>
“The Rockefellers and their allies have, for at least fifty years, been carefully following a plan to use their economic power to gain political control of first America, and then the rest of the world. Do I mean conspiracy? Yes, I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.” Congressman Larry P. McDonald, November 1975, from the introduction to a book titled The Rockefeller File.<br>
“There exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself.” – Daniel K. Inouye, US Senator from Hawaii,
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Inouye"<br>linktext was:"testimony at the Iran Contra Hearings, 1986"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
"All men having power ought to be mistrusted."--James Madison<br>
<br>
It is no coincidence that the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, creating the IRS and the Federal Reserve Bank were created in 1913 and World War I started in 1914. Since 1913 the United States of America has been controlled by a “Shadow Government. This continues to this day.<br>
Background<br>
Passed by Congress on July 2, 1909, and ratified February 3, 1913, the 16th Amendment established Congress's right to impose a Federal Income Tax. It allowed the federal government to levy an income tax. Most people at the time thought an income tax was a great idea.<br>
The Federal Reserve System was established as the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 the same year as 16th Amendment. The Federal Reserve, was conceived during a secret meeting on Jekyll Island. Edward Griffin charts the development of the Federal Reserve, and its effect on the economy, in the book 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Edward-Griffin/dp/091298645X"<br>linktext was:"The Creature from Jekyll Island."<br>====================================<br>
<br>
Griffin starts this carefully researched and sourced book with the story of a secret meeting that took place in 1910 on Jekyll Island, off the coast of Georgia. In attendance were six men who represented, according to the calculations in the book, one-fourth of the world's wealth at the time. Men associated with, and representing, interests of the Rockefellers, Morgans, Rothschilds and Warburgs met with Republican Senator Nelson W. Aldrich to figure out a way to allow them grow their interests, and to shift the national banking system from one of thrift to one of debt. What they came up with was the Federal Reserve.<br>
In order to organize the story of the Federal Reserve and its effects on the economy in a way that takes the reader on a journey and provides insightful information, Griffin has grouped 26 chapters into six sections. He also includes an appendix with parts. The book is not presented strictly chronologically, but addresses different, related concepts that illustrate the power and effects of the Federal Reserve. Two of the most interesting sections are II and III. Section II presents"A Crash Course On Money" and takes a look at the monetary system, gold based currency and fiat currency, and how it all works together. Section III addresses the"alchemy" of transforming the"lead bullets of war" into an"endless source of gold." Griffin asserts that modern wars have been largely possible by fiat currency, and the Federal Reserve has been central in this effort.<br>
When it comes to the Fed, Congress is mired in hypocrisy. The anti-regulation, de-regulation crowd on Capitol Hill shuts its mouth when it comes to the most powerful regulators of all – you and the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Congress goes along with the out-of-control, private government of the Fed—unaccountable to the national legislature.<br>

<div class="content">Blurey, it's a syndrome (societal disease) as much as a conspiracy (administration). It is not in control, it exercises control as much as it can. There are three main hubs, each a sovereign free state. The Crown of London (finance), the Vatican (religion), and Washington DC (military). There must also be something for media/PR/propaganda. Not everyone in power is evil. Most of the people involved consider themselves to be pragmatic and responsible. Like anything that has been existence a long time, there are many skeletons in closets that exercise enormous influence over current policy. It's an old, corrupt system. Governments are public dog and pony shows, but they do have clout. People are taken into consideration but as statistical masses. What bothers you is that you thought certain public people were in control; now you recognize certain private people operate behind the scenes, and it upsets you. Eventually, you will realize that civilization is ill and out of control. The symptoms are manifest.</div>

<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>WITH THE DECISION to upgrade Britain’s nuclear weapons system due this year, Jeremy Corbyn’s election as Labour leader couldn’t be more unwelcome to the British establishment. The pro-nuclear lobby is in overdrive, trying to discredit his commitment to scrapping Trident.<br>
<br>
The moral case against nuclear weapons is clear and powerful. Even the most adamant of nuclear advocates cannot go as far as to argue that inflicting indiscriminate destruction on millions of people and and on the planet is justifiable. Instead, they label Corbyn as ethical but unworldly, and so unfit to lead Britain.<br>
<br>
The practical case against Trident is equally clear and just as strong. Britain’s nuclear weapon simply doesn’t do what it says on the tin – protect Britain from threats to its security.<br>
<br>
Real security threats<br>
<br>
At the end of November, the government published its National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) 2015, alongside the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Nuclear attack is considered a Tier 2 threat, the same as it was in 2010. Nuclear attack is not among the short term dangers facing Britain; it’s one of seven potential long term threats.<br>
<br>
Terrorism and cyber-attacks were high on both lists, alongside overseas instability in the Middle East and North Africa where the UK has been militarily embroiled for the past 15 years. Three others are threats of a different character: public health epidemics, natural disasters, and activities by transnational criminal organisations and terrorist groups such as people trafficking.<br>
<br>
In the case of the seventh threat – from weapons of mass destruction – the NSRA considered chemical and biological attacks against Britain or UK military forces were the more likely scenarios.<br>
<br>
What good Trident in any of these situations? Indeed, experts are beginning to worry about threats to Trident – possibilities such as a cyber-attack which takes it out of operation, or underwater drones becoming capable of detecting its ‘silent’ submarines.<br>
<br>
Truth out: Trident is a billion-pound anachronism. If we didn’t replace it, the government would have funds to invest in productive ventures like house building and improvements to our road and rail networks – activities that would help grow the economy and generate more resources for health, education and social spending. And, of course, more cash to spare for actual threats to human security.<br>
<br>
Deterrent or target?<br>
<br>
What then explains this stubborn commitment to Trident? Nuclear weapons are, it’s claimed, a deterrent. Their very presence makes predatory powers such as Russia, or rogue states such as North Korea think twice before getting into a confrontation with Britain. Supposedly, the mere possession of nuclear weapons will keep us safe; we’ll never use them.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the pro-nuclear lobby, Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond let this particular cat out of the bag recently when asked to comment on a North Korean missile launch. ‘North Korea,’ he said, ‘seems to think having a nuclear weapon keeps them safe. In fact the opposite is true. Nuclear weapons make them a target.’<br>
<br>
Quite right Mr Hammond. And the same goes for Trident<br>
<br>
Nuclear proliferators<br>
<br>
The danger of proliferation by states such as North Korea is another favourite of the pro-nuclear lobby. Unilateral nuclear disarmament is madness, they say. Multilateralism is common sense. We are to place our trust in the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; Britain’s willing to get rid of its nuclear weapons just as soon as everybody else gets rid of theirs. But as the case of North Korea illustrates, the possession of nuclear weapons by powerful states is the driving force behind proliferation.<br>
<br>
The NPT came into force in 1970, reflecting international concern about the spread of nuclear weapons and the ever-growing stock piles of the nuclear armed states. The Treaty has three components: nuclear states agree to take steps to disarm; non-nuclear states agree not to acquire nuclear weapons; and everybody agrees to inspections which verify their status.<br>
<br>
Britain is one of 188 signatories and has ratified the NPT. In theory at least, this means the government is obliged to take steps to disarm. There are already two legal opinions that replacing Trident by a new, more-powerful nuclear weapons system is proliferation and would put Britain in breach of the NPT.<br>
<br>
A political tool<br>
<br>
Bottom line is, nuclear weapons have always been used as a political tool. The pro-nuclear lobby believes Trident keeps the Great in Britain, and us at the top table alongside the Americans. But individual advocates of Trident often fight shy of admitting this.<br>
<br>
At the outset the United States used its monopoly of nuclear weapons to bolster its ability to shape the terms of the post-war settlement. US Secretary of War Henry Stimson regarded the atom bomb ‘as a master card of diplomacy’. The then Secretary of State James Byrnes claimed it enabled America ‘to dictate our own terms at the end of the war’.<br>
<br>
Not to be left behind, the Churchill and Attlee governments alike were committed to building a British bomb – just as the Soviet Union, China, France, and others thereafter wanted their own bomb. Ernie Bevin, Attlee’s Foreign Secretary, is remembered as ‘the real patron of the British bomb’ – and for his colourful statement that there had to be a Union Jack flying on top of the atom bomb.<br>
<br>
Trident is not independent<br>
<br>
But Britain’s nuclear weapon are not, and never have been, independent. The UK relies on American technology. Trident is dependent on the United States in the following ways:<br>
<br>
Britain leases Trident missiles from the US;<br>
British submarines must regularly visit the US for maintenance and missile replacement;<br>
British warheads are a copy of US warheads, and some components are bought directly from the US;<br>
even though Trident submarines are built in Britain, many components are bought from the US; and<br>
Trident is dependent on US systems for practical information such as weather and navigational data necessary to target a nuclear weapon.<br>
<br>
Unsurprisingly, Britain’s access to American nuclear know-how comes at a price. It has bred tacit and unacknowledged obligations to support US military and foreign policy goals, while the bilateral Mutural Defence Agreement provides the US with access to British bases around the world and to communications and intelligence support from Menwith Hill monitoring station and Fylingdales radar base.<br>
<br>
The government doesn’t publish all the terms of the MDA. Indeed, considerable secrecy surrounds all Britain’s nuclear decision-making, including the allocation of large amounts of public funds. Trident means a democratic deficit for Britain as well as a financial one.<br>
<br>
The jobs myth<br>
<br>
Last but not least, a small but vociferous lobby within the labour movement has added its own particular twist to the debate over Trident, arguing that the nuclear industry preserves high-skilled, well-paid jobs. Skilled workers are essential to a prosperous economy, and Corbyn’s commitment to a defence diversification commission to deliver sustainable alternative employment was part of his leadership campaign.<br>
<br>
However, Trident is not the job-creator that some would have us believe. Studies show that the number of civilian jobs has shrunk considerably over its current life time. One such by Dr Steven Schofield calculates that cost cutting by the private companies which own and run Britain’s nuclear weapons facilities has resulted in a 57% decline in employment between 1990 and 2007 – from 26,300 to 11,300 jobs.<br>
<br>
Schofield estimates that Trident’s success or, if built, would generate 35-40% less jobs than the original project, but cost up to 100% more. That’s a poor rate of return for a multi-million investment.<br>
<br>
Investment in sustainable alternatives would generate more jobs at equivalent skill levels. A major programme of off-shore wind and wave power, for example, could generate 50% of the UK’s energy needs and create 25-30,000 new jobs. What’s more, if Britain scrapped Trident decommissioning the submarines and warheads would provide employment for between 5 and 10 years – time for alternatives to be bedded down.<br>
<br>
Labour’s defence review<br>
<br>
The Labour Party acknowledges that the ‘nature of the security threats facing Britain today differs from that of the threats we faced fifty years ago’. The National Policy Forum report to Labour’s 2014 annual conference committed the party to a review of defence policy after the general election. In January 2016, Shadow Defence Secretary Emily Thornberry published its terms of reference. Setting the context, she asks: ‘What role should Britain play in building a world that is more peaceful, more just and safer…?’<br>
<br>
For all these reasons, and more, scrapping Trident is the most realistic and hard-headed step that Britain could take towards more effective security for its citizens and a better world for all. </div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Covert war represents an expansion of US imperialism by means other than invasion and occupation. Historically, the Cold War was always a mixture of confrontation with the USSR through superior forces deployed across a global network of military bases, and the subversion of progressive governments when their attempts to control their own resources threatened Western corporate interests.<br>
<br>
Since the end of the Cold War the United States and its allies have maintained this combination of military power projection and covert warfare, including two major conventional wars in the Persian Gulf to secure oil resources, and raids by special operations forces combined with drone strikes <br>
in a growing number of countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. More recently, cyber warfare can also be added to the list of covert actions, with attacks on computer systems at Iran's civil nuclear research facilities</div></blockquote></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I don’t have all the answers, but I do believe that this is a sign that is significant for the United States.<br>
<br>
The bald eagle is the symbol of our nation, and 13 of them died just a few days after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead on February 13th.<br>
<br>
Justice Scalia was the foremost defender of the U.S. Constitution on the Supreme Court, and his death was a massive blow to those that love liberty and freedom everywhere.<br>
<br>
Once again, I don’t know what all of this means, but things were already looking incredibly bleak for our country even before the death of Scalia. Our country is dying a little bit more every day, and the signs are all around us.<br>
<br>
So could the death of these 13 bald eagles also be a sign that the death of the United States as a whole is rapidly approaching? It won’t happen tomorrow, but it is coming. I have been warning my readers over and over to get prepared for what is ahead, because I believe that we are heading for the worst times that this country has ever seen.<br>

What do you think?<br>

Do you agree with me that the death of these 13 bald eagles could be a sign?</div></blockquote>
