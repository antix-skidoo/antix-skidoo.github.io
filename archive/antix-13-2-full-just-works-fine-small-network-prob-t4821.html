<div class="content">Solution for my connection problem with ethernet: <br>
Using wicd, I changed eth1 to eth0 in preferences.<br>
<br>
The long story:<br>
I have a netbook, Dell mini 10 (1010)<br>
I have had problems with my wifi chip under various distros. (Broadcom BCM4312)<br>
Most times when it's not working I can get it working by jumping thru hoops with firmware.<br>
In one instance, I got wifi working, but then there was a conflict with my ethernet chip and the driver I was using for wifi. <br>
So in this case I had to make a choice if I wanted wifi or ethernet, but not both.<br>
Ethernet chip is (Realtek RTL810E/RTL8102E)<br>
<br>
Last night after trying MX-14_13.97 (beta1?), I removed it and re-installed AntiX 13.2 full<br>
Everything (hardware) worked out of the box, except my ethernet for some reason, so I assumed I had a driver/firmware conflict as mentioned above. <br>
Then I searched this forum and found a place to look for a solution.<br>
dolphin_oracle mentioned to someone to look at / etc /wicd/wired-settings.conf and manger-settings.conf<br>
This is where I noticed my ethernet was listed as eth1<br>
<br>
The reason I like to have wired ethernet working on this netbook is I prefer to update and install software over a wired connection.<br>
Thank you for reading this,<br>
Jon</div>

<div class="content">Some of those wifi chips get weird results. I had a 150Mbps Ralink usb adapter on my JUNKBOX that works great. I purchased off ebay a 300 Mbps usb wifi adapter (without looking to see what chipset it used) for cheap, but never could get it to work. After some research, I learned it had a Broadcom chipset that I never could get to work. So I just put the old one back in. I would love to set up a wired connection, but my dogs keep trying to drag it all over the place. The router is in one room, and my JUNKBOX is in another.</div>
