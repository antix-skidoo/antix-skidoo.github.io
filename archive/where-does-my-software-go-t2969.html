<div class="content">OK, follow along with this line of thought and tell me if it's logical or if I'm getting demented. As root, I enter the"lsusb" command. There, I see listed my USB adapter, and a particular Linux driver. Apparently, this is not the driver I need since the adapter doesn't work, so I need to get a different one. I go to the Ralink website, click on the Linux tab, and download a driver I think might work (model # is not exactly mine but close, so I want to try). I download it, and my download manager pops up showing 2 icons - one looks like a file folder, the other is a zipped file. I click on the zipped file and a window opens up displaying all the files inside. I click on"Select All" and click on extract. The dowmload directory pops up showing a highlighted default destination of"/(password)/media" (or something close to that). I reason that"root" is where I saw the other driver, and"root" is where I want the new driver to go, so I override the default command and enter"/root" and hit extract. The progress bar swings back &amp; forth and then I get a message to the effect that the file has been sucessfully sent to"root". I re-boot the computer, do another"lsusb" command and nothing's changed. The same original Linux driver is still in place. I'm obviously doing something wrong - what is it? I've got to believe that if I can eventually get the correct driver to show up in"lsusb" I'll be good to go. You're probably getting tired of seeing my posts everyday. If you'd like to see me shut up and go away (and I can well understand why you would), PLEASE answer these questions for me. I'm not trying to re-invent the wheel or redesign any software. I simply want to be able to configure my wireless, my printer, and control where my software downloads go. That's all. If I can learn these things, you may never hear from me again - though I make no promises.</div>

<div class="content">I don't have experience with your chipset, but I found this website that details how to install the driver for your card.<br>

Follow the instructions for Lenny, unless you have upgraded to the recent Squeeze release.<br>

I hope this helps. Wireless can be a challenging task and I have been dealing with some myself, although I seem to have prevailed.<br>
<br>
Good luck!</div>
