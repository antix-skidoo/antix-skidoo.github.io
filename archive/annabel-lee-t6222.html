<div class="content"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Annabel Lee By Edgar Allan Poe</span></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was many and many a year ago,<br>
In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
Than to love and be loved by me.<br>
<br>
I was a child and she was a child,<br>
In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
I and my Annabel Lee—<br>
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
Coveted her and me.<br>
<br>
And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
And bore her away from me,<br>
To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
In this kingdom by the sea.<br>
<br>
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
Went envying her and me—<br>
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br>
<br>
But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
Of those who were older than we—<br>
Of many far wiser than we—<br>
And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
<br>
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
In her sepulchre there by the sea—<br>
In her tomb by the sounding sea.</div>

<br>
<br>
The fountains mingle with the river<br>
And the rivers with the ocean,<br>
The winds of heaven mix for ever<br>
With a sweet emotion;<br>
Nothing in the world is single;<br>
All things by a law divine<br>
In one spirit meet and mingle.<br>
Why not I with thine?—<br>
<br>
See the mountains kiss high heaven<br>
And the waves clasp one another;<br>
No sister-flower would be forgiven<br>
If it disdained its brother;<br>
And the sunlight clasps the earth<br>
And the moonbeams kiss the sea:<br>
What is all this sweet work worth<br>
If thou kiss not me?</div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
WHY art thou silent? Is thy love a plant <br>
Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air <br>
Of absence withers what was once so fair? <br>
Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant? <br>
Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant,<br>
Bound to thy service with unceasing care— <br>
The mind's least generous wish a mendicant <br>
For nought but what thy happiness could spare. <br>
Speak!—though this soft warm heart, once free to hold <br>
A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine,<br>
Be left more desolate, more dreary cold <br>
Than a forsaken bird's-nest fill'd with snow <br>
'Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine— <br>
Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know!</div>

<div class="content"><strong>The Gods and The People by Voltairine de Cleyre</strong><br>
<br>
What have you done, O skies,<br>
That the millions should kneel to you?<br>
Why should they lift wet eyes,<br>
Grateful with human dew?<br>
<br>
Why should they clasp their hands,<br>
And bow at thy shrines, O heaven,<br>
Thanking thy high commands<br>
For the mercies that thou hast given?<br>
<br>
What have those mercies been,<br>
O thou who art called the Good?<br>
Who trod through a world of sin,<br>
And stood where the felon stood<br>
<br>
What is that wondrous peace<br>
Vouchsafed to the child of dust<br>
For whom all doubt shall cease<br>
In the light of thy perfect trust?<br>
<br>
How hast Thou heard their prayers<br>
Smoking up from the bleeding sod,<br>
Who, crushed by their weight of cares,<br>
Cried up to thee, Most High God<br>
<br>
... ... .... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br>
<br>
Where the swamps of Humanity sicken<br>
Read the answer in dumb, white scars!<br>
You, Skies, gave the sore and the stricken<br>
The light of your far- off stars!<br>
<br>
The children who plead are driven,<br>
Shelterless, through the street,<br>
Receiving the Mercy of heaven<br>
Hard-frozen in glittering Sleet!<br>
<br>
The women who prayed for pity,<br>
Who called on the saving Name,<br>
Through the walks of your merciless city,<br>
Are crying the rent, of shame!<br>
<br>
The starving, who gazed till the plenty<br>
In which they might not share<br>
Have died in their hunger, rent by<br>
The anguish of unheard prayer !<br>
<br>
The weary who plead for remission,<br>
For a moment only release,<br>
Have sunk, with unheeded petition--<br>
This the Christ-pledged Peace.<br>
<br>
These are the mercies of heaven,<br>
These are the answer of God<br>
To the prayers of the agony-shriven,<br>
From the paths where the millions plod!<br>
<br>
The Silent scorn of the sightless!<br>
The callous ear of the deaf!<br>
The wrath of Might to the mightless!<br>
The shroud and the mourning sheaf!<br>
<br>
Light--to behold their squalor!<br>
Breath --to draw in life's pain!<br>
Voices to plead and call for<br>
Heaven's help--hearts tip bleed--in vain!<br>
<br>
... ... .... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br>
<br>
What have you done, O Church,<br>
That the weary should bless your name?<br>
Should come with faith's holy torch<br>
To light up your altered fane?<br>
<br>
Why should they kiss the folds<br>
Of The garment of your High Priest?<br>
Or bow to the chalice that holds<br>
The wine of your Sacred Feast?<br>
<br>
Have you blown out the breath of their sighs?<br>
Have you strengthened the weak, the ill?<br>
Have you wiped the dark tears from their eyes,<br>
And bade their sobbing be still?<br>
<br>
Have you touched, have you known, have you felt,<br>
Have you bent and softly smiled<br>
In the face of the woman who dealt<br>
In lewdness--to feed her child?<br>
<br>
Have you heard the cry in the night<br>
Going up from the outraged heart,<br>
Masked from the social sight<br>
By the cloak that but angered the smart?<br>
<br>
Have you heard the children's moan,<br>
By the light of the skies denied?--<br>
Answer, O Walls of Stone,<br>
In the name of your Crucified!<br>
<br>
. ... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br>
<br>
Out of the clay of their heart-break,<br>
From the red dew of its sod,<br>
You have mortared your bricks for Christ's sake<br>
And reared a palace to God<br>
<br>
Your painters have dipped their brushes<br>
In the tears and the blood of the race<br>
Whom, living, your dark frown crushes<br>
And limned--a dead Saviour's face!<br>
<br>
Ye have seized, in the name of God, the<br>
Child's crust from famine's dole;<br>
You have taken the price of its body<br>
And sung a mass for its soul!<br>
<br>
You have smiled on the man, who, deceiving,<br>
Paid exemption to ease your wrath !<br>
You have cursed the pour fool who believed him,<br>
Though her body lay prone in your path !<br>
<br>
You have laid the seal on the lip !<br>
You have bade us to be content !<br>
To bow 'neath our master's whip,<br>
And give thanks for the scourge--"heaven sent."<br>
<br>
These, O Church are your thanks :<br>
These are the fruits without flaw,<br>
That flow from the chosen ranks<br>
Who keep in your perfect law !<br>
<br>
Doors hard locked on the homeless,<br>
Stained glass windows for bread !<br>
On the living, the law of dumbness,<br>
And the law of need, for-the dead!<br>
<br>
Better the dead, who, not needing,<br>
Go down to the vaults of the earth,<br>
Than the living whose hearts lie bleeding,<br>
Crushed by you at their very birth!<br>
<br>
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br>
<br>
What have you done, O State,<br>
That the toilers should shout your ways?<br>
Should light up the fires of their hate<br>
If a"traitor" should dare dispraise?<br>
<br>
How do you guard the trust<br>
That the people repose in you?<br>
Do you keep to the law of the just,<br>
And hold to the changeless true?<br>
<br>
What do you mean when you say<br>
"The home of the free and brave?"<br>
How free are your people, pray?<br>
Have you no such thing as a slave?<br>
<br>
What are the lauded"rights,"<br>
Broad-sealed by your Sovereign Grace?<br>
What are the love-feeding sights<br>
You yield to your subject race?<br>
<br>
... .. ... ... ... ... ... ...<br>
<br>
The rights?-Ah ! the right to toil,<br>
That another, idle, may reap ;<br>
The right to make fruitful the soil,<br>
And a meagre pittance to keep.<br>
<br>
The right of a woman to own<br>
Her body spotlessly pure,<br>
And starve in the street--alone!<br>
The right of the wronged--to endure !<br>
<br>
The right of the slave--to its yoke,<br>
The right of the hungry--to pray,<br>
The right, of the toiler--to vote<br>
For the master who buys his day !<br>
<br>
You have sold the sun and the air,<br>
You have dealt in the price of blood,<br>
You have taken the lion's share<br>
While the lion is fierce for food!<br>
<br>
You have laid the load of the strong<br>
On the helpless, the young, the weak!<br>
You have trod out the purple of wrong;--<br>
Beware where its wrath shall wreak!<br>
<br>
"Let the voice of the People be heard!<br>
O--" You strangled it with your rope,<br>
Denied the last dying word<br>
While your Trap and your Gallows spoke!<br>
<br>
But a thousand voices rise<br>
Where the words of the martyr fell ;<br>
The seed springs fast to the Skies<br>
Watered deep from that bloody well !<br>
<br>
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br>
<br>
Hark! Low down you will hear<br>
The storm in the underground!<br>
Listen, tyrants, and fear!<br>
Quake at that muffled sound<br>
<br>
"Heavens that mocked our dust,<br>
Smile on, in your pitiless blue!<br>
Silent as you are to us,<br>
So silent are we to you!<br>
<br>
"Churches that scourged our brains,<br>
Priests that locked fast our hands!-<br>
We planted the torch in Your chains:<br>
Now gather the burning brands!<br>
<br>
"States, that have given us law,<br>
When we asked for the right to earn bread--<br>
The Sword that Damocles saw<br>
By a hair swings over your head!<br>
<br>
What ye have sown ye shall reap :<br>
Teardrops, and Blood, and Hate,<br>
Gaunt gather before your Seat<br>
And knock at your palace gate!<br>
<br>
"There are murderers on your thrones,<br>
There are thieves in your Justice halls!<br>
White Leprosy cancers their stones,<br>
And gnaws at their worm-eaten walls!<br>
<br>
"And the Hand of Belshazzar's Feast<br>
Writes over, in flaming light,<br>
'Thought's kingdom no more to the Priest;<br>
Nor the law of Right to the Might.'"</div>

<div class="content">Georg Heym (1887-1912)<br>
<strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">The War</span></strong><br>
(1911)<br>
(translated from German by Walter A. Aue, 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://myweb.dal.ca/waue/Trans/Heym-Krieg.html"<br>linktext was:"http://myweb.dal.ca/waue/Trans/Heym-Krieg.html"<br>====================================<br>
)<br>
<br>
Now he has arisen: he, who slept so long,<br>
from the depth arisen, out of arches strong.<br>
Huge he stands and unknown in the twilight land,<br>
and the moon he crushes in his blackened hand.<br>
<br>
Broad on city's evening, wide and angrily<br>
shadows fall, and frost of strange obscurity<br>
makes the market's bustle stop in icy scare.<br>
Silence reigns. They turn - and no one is aware.<br>
<br>
In the street it comes to touch her shoulders light:<br>
Just a question. Answerless. A face goes white.<br>
From afar the abbey bells are whining thin<br>
and the beards are quaking round the pointed chin.<br>
<br>
High up, on the mountains, he begins to dance,<br>
and he cries: You fighters, rise up and advance!<br>
Echoes sound: around his shaking, blackened head<br>
swings a chain of skulls he wrenched from thousand dead.<br>
<br>
Tower-like he squashes embers' dying gleam<br>
and, where day is fleeing, fills with blood the stream.<br>
Countless are the corpses swept into the reeds,<br>
covered by white feathers, where the vulture feeds.<br>
<br>
He stands over ramparts blue of flames around,<br>
over darkened streets with heavy weapons sound,<br>
over broken gates where gatemen lie across,<br>
over bridges bending under human dross.<br>
<br>
Through the night he chases fire across the world:<br>
red-fanged hound of hell with savage scream unfurled.<br>
Out of darkness leaps dominion of night,<br>
frightful at its border shine volcanoes bright.<br>
<br>
And a thousand redcaps, pointed far and wide,<br>
litter up the dark plain, flicker up astride.<br>
Those below in alleys, running to and fro,<br>
he sweeps in the fire, that it hotter grow.<br>
<br>
And the flames are leaping, burning tree by tree.<br>
Yellow bats of fire clawing endlessly.<br>
And he thrusts his kiln-staff, dark and charcoal-bound<br>
deep amongst the trees to stoke the flames around.<br>
<br>
An important city, chocked in yellow glow,<br>
jumped without a whisper to the depths below,<br>
while he stands, a giant, over glowing urns,<br>
wild, in bloody heavens, thrice his torch he turns<br>
<br>
over stormstrung clouds reflecting fiery brands,<br>
to the deadly dark of frigid desert sands,<br>
down he pours the fires, withering the night,<br>
phosphorus and brimstone on Gomorrha bright.</div>

<div class="content">Wilfred Owen - Strange Meeting<br>
<br>
It seemed that out of battle I escaped<br>
Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped<br>
Through granites which titanic wars had groined.<br>
<br>
Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,<br>
Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.<br>
Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared<br>
With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,<br>
Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless.<br>
And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,— <br>
By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell.<br>
<br>
With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained;<br>
Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,<br>
And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.<br>
“Strange friend,” I said, “here is no cause to mourn.” <br>
“None,” said that other, “save the undone years,<br>
The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,<br>
Was my life also; I went hunting wild<br>
After the wildest beauty in the world,<br>
Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,<br>
But mocks the steady running of the hour,<br>
And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.<br>
For by my glee might many men have laughed,<br>
And of my weeping something had been left,<br>
Which must die now. I mean the truth untold,<br>
The pity of war, the pity war distilled.<br>
Now men will go content with what we spoiled.<br>
Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.<br>
They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress. <br>
<br>
None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.<br>
Courage was mine, and I had mystery;<br>
Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery: <br>
To miss the march of this retreating world<br>
Into vain citadels that are not walled.<br>
Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels, <br>
I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,<br>
Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.<br>
I would have poured my spirit without stint<br>
But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.<br>
Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.<br>
<br>
“I am the enemy you killed, my friend.<br>
I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned<br>
Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.<br>
I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.<br>
Let us sleep now. . . .”</div>

<div class="content"><strong>A Sane Revolution - Poem by D.H. Lawrence</strong><br>
<br>
If you make a revolution, make it for fun,<br>
don't make it in ghastly seriousness,<br>
don't do it in deadly earnest,<br>
do it for fun.<br>
<br>
Don't do it because you hate people,<br>
do it just to spit in their eye.<br>
<br>
Don't do it for the money,<br>
do it and be damned to the money.<br>
<br>
Don't do it for equality,<br>
do it because we've got too much equality<br>
and it would be fun to upset the apple-cart<br>
and see which way the apples would go a-rolling.<br>
<br>
Don't do it for the working classes.<br>
Do it so that we can all of us be little aristocracies on our own<br>
and kick our heels like jolly escaped asses.<br>
<br>
Don't do it, anyhow, for international Labour.<br>
Labour is the one thing a man has had too much of.<br>
Let's abolish labour, let's have done with labouring!<br>
Work can be fun, and men can enjoy it; then it's not labour.<br>
Let's have it so! Let's make a revolution for fun!<br>
<br>
David Herbert Lawrence</div>
