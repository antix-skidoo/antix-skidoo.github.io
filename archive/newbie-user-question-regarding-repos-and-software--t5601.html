<div class="content">Hi<br>
Im brand new to Antix 13.2 which I have installed on an Old dell Laptop and really enjoy using it for my at the moment simple needs <br>
My main Laptop has a very popular Linux distro which is more easy to use but i would like to delve deeper into Linux ..but slowly!<br>
BUT the thing is dont know if im doing things correctly with AntiX if that makes sense there are so many things that are confusing me ..for example <br>
Repositories <br>
When I first installed I installed stable version 13.2 Wheezy or something but was unable to update <br>
I read about the problem and re installed the Testing Repo version as the stable one did not seem to download any updates at all<br>
When I check my repositories I have 3 only ticked and enabled <br>
My question is how do you know what Repositories should be enabled there are many more sections that are not enabled what would happen if I enabled them <br>
and how do I know my system is safe?<br>
Also I did watch a runwithdolphins video on youtube regarding adding a software centre but cant understand what to do as it says in the notes <br>
You can add the MX repo to your / etc/apt/sources.list.d/antix.list by putting this line at the bottom and refreshing sources: deb 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://main.mepis-deb.org/mepiscr/repo/"<br>linktext was:"http://main.mepis-deb.org/mepiscr/repo/"<br>====================================<br>
 mepis12cr main non-free Â and install"apt-notifier" from synaptic.<br>
<br>
I have no idea how to do that or where to start<br>
<br>
I have looked at the Edit config files list and it really means nothing to me as does much of what is on the system to be honest but am trawling the net picking small tips up..Small steps!!<br>
<br>
Sorry if the questions seem strange or really basic but thats me!<br>
Any help in very basic terms would be most grateful<br>
I dare say i will post more questions in future but i was the same with my Main Distro as i migrated from Windows after using that for about 15 Years and everything was a complete mystery but now i would never go back to MS<br>
Thankyou</div>

<div class="content">For starters. After a install. You open a terminal and do<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo apt-get update</code></pre></div>
Secondly. Howdy and Welcome. The above command would have worked in Stable, Testing, or Unstable to update package list in Synaptic Package Manager.<br>
<br>
Your system is as safe as you ask it to be. Mine have been safe for ages.<br>
Even when I had no clue on what I was doing on computers.<br>

Too many questions for my foggy brain this morning to process, so I will let others reply on your questions.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome to antiX! antiX is lean and mean, and a little"closer to the metal" than some other distros out there. Its a necessary trade off to be able to boot on some of the truly old gear that antiX will run on. <br>
<br>
You ask some pretty good questions regarding the repos. The following is true of just about every debian-based linux distribution out there.<br>
<br>
1. antiX is based on Debian. Debian wheezy is the current stable debian release. Debian jessie is the current"testing" release, and is the version that will become the next stable release. What this means is the software in testing is more up to date than the wheezy version. However, the wheezy version is still being updated, so its perfectly valid way to run, and is the way I'm currently set up myself. <br>
<br>
On a freshly installed system, no upgrades will appear available until the repo sources are refreshed.<br>
<br>
The way to upgrade your install is to first update your sources with:<br>
as root:<br>
<br>
apt-get update (this refreshing the source lists so the system knows whats available)<br>
<br>
and then <br>
<br>
apt-get dist-upgrade (this actually downloads and installs the upgrades)<br>
<br>
or you can"reload" and"Mark all upgrades" in synaptic and hit the"apply" button. The effect is the same as the cli commands.<br>
<br>
Assuming your internet connection is running, this should bring in all the new updates. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. By default, you should have a antix.daveserver entry (either testing or stable depending on your choice) and two debian servers (one main, one security) (again, stable or testing depending on your choice.) <br>
<br>
3. all of the source entries are stored in a text files (with a .list extenstion) located in / etc/apt/sources.list.d/ The text files are commented so you can see what each repo is for. adding a repo is simply a matter of inserting a new repo definition into this file and then updating the sources (either by apt-get update or by hitting the"reload" button on the synatpic toolbar). Once a source is added, new packages will be available for installation in synaptic. You can also add repos in synaptic, but its really easier (seriously, its really is easier) to copy and paste the definitions directly into the .list text file of choice.<br>
<br>
4. adding a software center is really not necessary, as all the packages that will be offered in it are already accessible in synaptic. However, it is somewhat easier to browse in a software center, but the debian/ubuntu software center is slooowwww. <br>
<br>
I do like the apt-notifier app from MX though. Its quite nice to be notified of updates.<br>
<br>

<div class="content">Welcome and Howdy to the board. I bet you feel like a deer in a headlight; lost and confused on what to do. Runwiththedolphin has great videos to help, but you can get confused with them sometimes.<br>
<br>
AntiX is a Debian-based linux distro. MX-14 is a collaboration between the AntiX community and the MEPIS community that uses Debian linux, but it is a different distro. Similar but different.<br>
<br>
Debian uses <span style="color: #FF0040">Stable</span> apps (once labeled Wheezy and now called Jessie), <span style="color: #4000FF">Testing</span> (which still have a few bugs in them), and <span style="color: #00BF00">Unstable</span> (which are experimental). Once an <span style="color: #008000">Unstable</span> app has been check and rechecked, tested and retested until it works okay but still has bugs, that app may go to <span style="color: #4000FF">Testing</span> for others to try out. When all the little bugs are finally corrected and the app works the way it should, it may be submitted as<span style="color: #FF0000"> Stable</span>. But that <strong>app is thoroughly tested and has to be approved</strong> by the comity who checks these things before it is approved as Stable.<br>
<br>
If you want everything to work correctly, use the Stable repos (which are usually labeled as MAIN). These are usually the ones you want so your system doesn't go haywire. The repositories for AntiX <strong><em>ARE DIFFERENT</em></strong> from MX-14. Just use what you install with and everything will be okay. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Everyone thankyou for the quick and informative replies your right i do feel like a deer in headlights! But unlike most distros ive tried i am enjoying AntiX so much ill keep on with it until i drive myself crazy or get to grips with it! <br>
I have installed MX14 on an old HP laptop but do not enjoy it as much as AntiX13.2 for some reason and with MX14 when i play videos back with VLC the CPU goes crazy to 100% other than that its ok but not as good (on my laptop anyway) Just a question (i know i should really post a seperate one but how long will AntiX 13.2 be supported for?<br>
Thankyou again for your answers ..and for your patience its something that is sometimes lacking in the Linux community with newbies and im sure turns some people off Linux and back to Windows<br>

<div class="content">That is not so much a question of how long AntiX 13.2 will be supported, as how long will whichever version of Debian you are using, will be supported. <br>
<br>
Quite a few updates get backported to 'Stable'. You should also be able to 'distupgrade' to the next 'Stable', (was Wheezy, will be Jessie), this is how Debian is designed.</div>

Depends. On what you are using. Stable? Anti posted about that. But durn if I can find it. So I know this is what he posted about. Debian Wheezy , which 13.2 stable is based on. Is now considered a LTS version and support ends no time soon. Debian will be supporting Wheezy for awhile. Heck. Debian Squeeze support was extended also. So do not sweat running stable. <br>
<br>
<span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
If running testing repos. No end of life.<br>
<br>
If running unstable. No end of life.</div>
