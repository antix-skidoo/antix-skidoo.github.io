Excerpt:<br>
<br>
<strong>"Berta Isabel Cáceres Flores</strong>  was a Honduran environmental activist, indigenous leader of her people,<sup>[7]</sup> and co-founder and coordinator of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH).<sup>[8]</sup><sup>[9]</sup><sup>[10]</sup> She won the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015, for"a grassroots campaign that successfully pressured the world’s largest dam builder to pull out of the Agua Zarca Dam" at the Río Gualcarque.<sup>[11]</sup><br>
<br>
She was assassinated in her home by armed intruders, after years of threats against her life.<sup>[12]</sup> Twelve environmental activists were killed in Honduras in 2014, according to research by Global Witness, which makes it the most dangerous country in the world, relative to its size, for activists protecting forests and rivers.<sup>[13]</sup> Her murder was followed by two more of activists within the month.<br>
<br>
<br>
A former soldier with the US-trained special forces units of the Honduran military asserted that Caceres' name was included on a hitlist distributed to them months before her assassination.<sup>[14]</sup> According to a February 2017 investigation by <em>The Guardian</em>, court papers show that three of the eight people arrested in connection with the assassination are linked to the US-trained elite troops. Two of them, Maj Mariano Díaz and Lt Douglas Giovanny Bustillo, received military training in the US, in Fort Benning, Georgia. This was the site of the former School of the Americas (SOA), now known as WHINSEC; the SOA has been linked to thousands of murders and human right violations by its graduates in Latin America<sup>[15]</sup><sup>[16]"</sup></div>

<div class="content">It is a sad day. Just because someone is taught something does not mean they are going to use it for good only. Several gangs in the US have started using military tactics fighting for gang control so  an assumption can be made they are ex-military.</div>

<div class="content">Among the most vicious of dictatorial regimes, Pinochet's officers, received training in SOA,  some of them, Chileans, were sent by the Clinton administration to Chiapas in 94-97 to advise the Mexican military on repression tactics.  There is a place where bloodshed resulted in rivers of blood in some Chiapas towns and a total communication blockade to prevent press of publishing anything live.<br>
<br>
In Oaxaca a few years later and during the uprising there, while on calm streets, one of the founders of indymedia.org was shot by a sniper and was killed.  People next to him said they didn't even hear a shot and the bullet must have come from very far away.<br>
<br>
True social change nevertheless can only be achieved peacefully, and by exposing the other side's choice  of violent means.  Right?  Right!</div>
