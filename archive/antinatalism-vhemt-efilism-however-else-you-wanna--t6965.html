<div class="content">Hey y'alls. I noticed that a longtime user told me not to use the shoutbox for political commentary as it could warrant a ban. So I think I'll use this subforum here for my antinatalist ramblings from now on, mkay? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
<br>
To keep things simple and short, antinatalism is a philosophical position that places a negative value on birth. A very often referenced book by David Benetar 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.amazon.com/Better-Never-Have-Been-Existence/dp/0199549265"<br>linktext was:"(better to have never been)"<br>====================================<br>
 explains the framework like this:<br>
<span style="color: #FF0000">If you are born, you feel pain, and will die. (negative)</span><br>
If you are not born, you will not feel pain or die<span style="color: #40FF00"> (positive)</span><br>
If you are born, you will feel pleasure <span style="color: #40FF00">(positive)</span><br>
If you are not born, you will not feel pleasure ("neutral; not good or bad" as Benetar describes it--but a <span style="color: #40FF00">positive</span> in my opinion. Since the highs of pleasure only make the lows of depression/whatever-your-ailment-may-be even worse).<br>
<br>
tl;dr There are more positives to not giving birth than there are positives to doing the opposite. Nothing can be sad that it wasn't born, that's just dumb on-its-face, but yet I still hear that argument quite often as well. You can't feel pain if you aren't born, and to be born you 100% guaranteed will feel some degree of harm. It's that simple but somehow according to the breeders it isn't <strong>*headache throbbing*</strong> <br>
<br>
Now, I did not know about this whole <em>antinatalism</em> thing until I was around 20 years old (21 now) however for as long as I can remember I had beliefs based around this principle. The most common question I get is"why not just be like everyone else?" , which somehow folks don't seem to get makes me turn even further and further antinatalist."You'll just get over it" is a phrase that empowers me more than it frightens me. Back when I was a teenager the"You'll just get over it" might have been scary but now when I hear it it makes my rage against the pain machine of existence even stronger. The more the folks want me to be normal, the more I want to do everything in my power to spite them, because they keep further and further convincing me how wrong they are by the day. This is why all my computers use Linux, I'm a member of VHEMT.org , got a vasectomy at 21 (which multiple insurance agencies tried to prevent me from getting: again, brilliant. Doctors I never met trying to control my body is really gonna make me not wanna control my body(?????)), I play music on my own hand build FM radio transmitter so I never have to listen to censored radio edit crap ever again, I'm running 2 Youtube channels with 1 for my own personal entertainment and another for political rantings and ramblings (mainly on the topics of antinatalism/antihumanism/anticapitalism/anti-software patents), etc.<br>
<br>
Even when I was very young, probably as young as 7, I knew there was no point in existence and therefore no point in being forced into that existence, so why is it that nobody else can see how bad life really is? The most common response to that one is"stop watching the news" but I don't! Denial of the true realities of life (i.e. parents killed their children by definition) seems to be the worst systematic problem humanity faces, and the resulting poisonous concoction is natalism, nationalism, and nepotism (the latter 2 basically only serving to reinforce natalism). Very, very skeptical we'll ever be able to get past any of this stuff as a collective species since people keep confusing intercourse with having DNA trophies (children).<br>

<div class="content">Yeah, when I was younger I was some kind of antinatalist, too. Reading Schopenhauer and Cioran. Now, that I am older, life has become more troublesome, yet paradoxically at the same time also sweeter and more precious.<br>

There is a nice old Russian song on (or rather against?) antinatalism/efilism. Have a look at"Если у вас нету тёти" ("If You Do Not Have an Aunt"), interpreted by the New York group PigPen – and don't miss the English subtitles, in case you don't understand Russian :

That song was fantastic and honestly made my day. Thanks <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
and I enjoy Schopenhauer as well. Haven't read too much Cioran (yet, but i intend to very soon). Some of my fellow antinatal YouTubers have made videos reading his work.</div>

Like I said before, that's just flat on it's face retarded.<br>
<br>
Humans have made no progress whatsoever in the thousands of years weve been on this planet (i.e. 90 percent of people breed. 50 percent of americans believe earth is 6000 years old. Cancer and AIDS and famine exist but you don't see those every day so I'm sure you are gonna ignore that).<br>
<br>
Once you bring a person into existence, you have no control over the pain they feel. That's pure arrogance to assume (make an ass out of you and me) that your DNA trophy wanted to be born, or that you'll make their life somehow better (not gonna happen), or that somehow you or some other humans will have a significant enough effect to nullify the pain. In short, your post is the epicenter of the problem, because it's all the same arguments I hear again and again. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. That's what the breeders are doing. There's no argument to be had in that respect. You want to kill folks and make excuses about it. That's just plain evil and I will do anything I can to stop it.</div>

I just think the whole idea of antinatalism is reactionary rubbish. Clearly you do not believe that we can make life on earth for all existing humans (and other species) better. You would call that Utopian (not going to happen). The same could be said about 'persuading' people to stop breeding. Or are you in favour of forced sterilisation!!?<br>
Sounds like a certain German guy who did the same to non-Aryans.<br>
As I said, reactionary drivel.</div>

You're the only one saying you'll make things better. If no humans exist they don't feel anything, bad nor good, and somehow I'm being reactionary saying that?<br>
<br>
of course nothing I want to happen is going to happen, hence life. Just like how your life or your DNA trophy's life is not going to happen how you want it, no matter how much you try to fit the square peg in the round hole. You are the one being the <strong>definition</strong> of reactionary. You think"women controlling their own body" means"being pushed around by men into having babies." Somehow you can't see that you're stomping on the freedoms your pretending to be all for. You want to force people to carry all pregnancies to term and somehow you're a socialist? WTF? You think you believe in freedom and you don't want to stop all further deaths? Seems like some extreme dishonesty, or at least talking out of both sides of your mouth.</div>

<div class="content">You're assuming that women want to be pregnant because they had sex (usually for less than ten minutes on average. by the way 80% of women never ejaculate or feel any pleasure from sex, they do it because of societal pressures from men who run the entire world; it's called patriarchy. And no I'm not a feminist). That's blatantly wrong. And even worse is saying that it is a good thing. Excusing the brutality of nature is not okay. Nature isn't your buddy. It's your killer.</div>

<div class="content">All pregnancies should be terminated, and all males and females should be sterilized. But I'm not gonna force anyone to do that. Using force (like the breeders do) only makes people more hostile towards us.<br>
<br>
By the way, in reference to all this stuff about abortion, sterilization, etc... I'm only referring to countries where it would be feasible to get that done. I'm not saying even the arranged-Married wives of mullahs in the middle east need to all terminate their pregnancies, because even terminating one pregnancy in a country under sharia law is much easier said than done.</div>

 <div class="content">Well, from what I got from your post, antinatalism is against birth, therefore you are looking to wipe out humanity.<br>
<br>
Over here, the younger generations get to pay for their elders, we all have, so when you get old there won't be anyone left - does that really make sense to you!<br>
<br>
The planet will just end up devoid of life.</div>
