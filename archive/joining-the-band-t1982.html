<div class="content">I am usually a 'sidux' user. Happily. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> However, their recent switch to KDE4 had me dropping down to their very excellent Xfce. I just don't get along with KDE4 and to make matters worse, it apparently doesn't get along with my main machine. (Should say my used to be main machine. It died. NO MORE HP for me... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> 2nd one with issues.)<br>
<br>
Before that tx1000 kicked the bucket, I got into Xfce as Gnome just never did it for me and I have concerns with all the mono... :p<br>
<br>
I have been using Linux now for just about 2yrs. My learning curve is best described as gradual. It was pretty heavy at first. I ran through many distros and have tried only Mint as something Ubuntu. I just never could get into Ubuntu. When Mint died on me, due it turned out to a bad HDD on the old work computer. I had moved on temporarily to something Gentoo based. I soon discovered, though it was likable and useful in it's way, that Gentoo sorta takes too much time in maintaining it and additionally, being only partly Gentoo compatible was making me do more work than I wanted and spending more time maintaining than using...<br>
<br>
Eventually it broke. At which point... I discovered 'sidux' and never looked back... till the KDE4. KDE4 and the tx1000 just don't like each other! I even tried what was my first Linux and holds a bit of a fond place, Mandriva... I got the same issues with it's kde4 as with sidux so I'm sure it's just a kde4 thing.<br>
<br>
My favorite DE's are Enlightenment 17 and Xfce. So discovering Antix was great. It's lightweight, using many good 'tools' from various sources and bringing them together.<br>
<br>
I very much like the control panel setup. This puts me in mind of the two distros I like to give to students and those totally new to using linux.(PClinuxOS &amp; Mandriva)<br>
<br>
I have actually never tried Mepis, but did download Mepis 8 as well as antiX. I found myself just instantly take with antiX. I looked at Mepis 8, for myself personally, it's not what I want. <br>
<br>
I decided I feel that KDE4 and KDE and Gnome are too bloated in general. For daily use, I just want a desktop that's convenient but doesn't make things to complicated. I found Xfce, that is an Xfce without GNOME under it is fine for me... The only other Xfce that isn't loaded with GNOME is sidux xfce... <br>
<br>
I quickly took antiX and antiX base and have added Xfce and Enlightenment to them... alas, on a dead machine, but it will soon go here in my 'little' space on my wife's 10.1 in netbook. <br>
<br>
Sorry, no namebrand you guys probably heard of... a little Chinese brand called Hasee. (They put linux on their machines here in China and they have turned out to be wonderfully Linux friendly therefore.) I use them cause ironically they work, my HPs which I spent a bit of trouble and time having shipped from USA to me here don't function or function fully anymore the most expensive of which didn't evne last much longer than 7-8 months.<br>
<br>
I am now making a remaster for students. (save myself some time when I set up their linux. The school forces or tries to, everyone to use XP or Vista. The school server requires them to login to access internet outside campus and the idiot tool to do this is a windows only app. I even encountered one of the computer teachers, but surprised that he didn't just use virtual box to install XP and login then go on about his business with Linux. instead he actually put Xp on his computer. But then truth be told, in general, critical thinking skills is not something they seem to teach here on the mainland. SO they just assume, can't use linux, must use winduds.) I have to use PClinuxOS for this at the moment. It has an easy remastering tool and of course has the Control Center which is helpful for new users. My coding skills are non existent. <br>
<br>
I have looked online, it seems the tool PClinuxOS is using, was originally a Debian project/tool a few years ago when it started but was no longer worked on. Why hasn't anyone used this very simple tool in Debian?<br>
<br>
I also found out on my antiX that when using another Desktop, Xfce or E17, the wonderfuly control panel seems unavailable? Is there a way to make it more available? So that when we add another desktop, we can still use it? I think that would be great for the next update of antiX. <br>
<br>
It would also be great if the debian version of Makelivecd were available as well. What are we currently using to 'remaster'? I have read I recall that Mepis has a tool? But it's not as easy or simple to use. Anyone here used it or know how?<br>
<br>
I would be very greatful. antiX is my answer for a light fast, and not bloated system, and it has so many ease of use tools. I don't only want to give an RPM based distro livecd to the students, I also want to offer something good in Debian which is what I personally use most to them. Linux is about choice, so while they are learning there are alternatives, they can see choices from the two main branches. <br>
<br>
Also with Debians vast repositories, that is a wondeful addition and I like that with antiX I can go either way. Towards Stable or from Testing to sid. (But being able to go to Stable is really great for a lot of 'average' users. They don't need cutting edge, mostly they need stability which was why I also took a look at Mepis.) For me the biggest problem is the nature of people and the nature of people in this culture.<br>
<br>
They typically 'wait' for someone else to do it for them, and I spend more time trying to setup their Linux installs for them than I do with my own computer and there are just too many students. So I really need remasters or image copies to install. <br>
<br>
Anyone know some good debian solutinos taht are simple and easy to use for either an Image copy that can be installed or a LiveCD remaster that can be installed, let me know... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
I am not a new antiX user and very surpirsed and pleased with this distro. I like 'sidux' and have had one on my school/work computer for 2yrs now. However, for that kind of situation, I have wanted a good distro that lends itself towards being set up to the stable repository. <br>
<br>
In some instances, I don't always feel the need for 'sid' cutting edge. Most instances actually. <br>
<br>
keep up the great work and look forward to see the new tools and ideas that get incorporated to a lively and great distro... <br>
<br>
(Don't know how this will work out. I can't even directly reach this forum. I have to go through a proxy site. It's blocked by my provider. I also have no choice in that either. The provider. Because somehow the contract of this particular building is held by this 1 provider. No other ISP/phone service is allowed to provide service to all these buildings here... gotta love China. My other choice and only other option is rediculously expensive 3g of which there is only 1 company that uses world standard and it doesn't seem once again that any usb modems sold for 3g are of course linux compatible. But then it's not like after seeing recent news the gov, who by the way declared back in 2004 that all gov complexes should sue Linux when they upgrade, is totally behind giving the common populace winduds because all their spyware and other big brother is watching you stuff works so well and is set up for winduds... Somewhat why the school I work for wants to force everyone to use winduds. They also check all the foreign teachers email that passes through their server, of course I don't live on campus so I don't at least have to worry about it, but then I would just use a proxy anyway so I guess I still wouldn't worry about it. So, lets see if I can submit this. I already can see I can't make sue of the chat... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> )</div>

<div class="content">Wow. Talk about dedication. My Hat is off to you and I bow sir. I hope you are going to be able to participate here even though you have restrictions I see.<br>
<br>
One of the other members might shed light on being able to bring up control center in xfce or E17. Alas I do not run either or have the skills to tell you.<br>

<div class="content">Hi Maotaoying (that's some name...)<br>
<br>
I've been using both Mepis and antiX for a long time but switched my laptop briefly from antiX to sidux (mainly because sidux pulled down a stronger wireless signal), but then switched back to antiX-base. I really liked sidux, especially xfce (like you, I've gotten away from heavier distros entirely). Now I'm focusing on getting an antiX-base install just the way I like it, hoping to get a good remastering procedure set up. I want to be able to get that custom system re-installed from an easy live-cd boot. The remastering conversation comes up here and there at this forum and at mepislovers.org. We probably need a separate category for that. Some recent discussion popped up here: <br>

Any ideas you have on this would be welcome. Glad you're pushing onward way over there in China...</div>

<div class="content">你好 (Hello) Maotaoying and welcome!<br>
<br>
I started my linux adventure about 3 years ago with Ubuntu and then switched to Linux Mint. After much distrohopping, I found Antix and I have been very happy eversince. Antix is very flexible and very powerful.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the distro and post any questions or comments and someone will try to help.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

<div class="content">hello and welcome to antix.<br>
antix uses a script for the control center. it is found in /usr/local/bin and it's called antixcc-en.sh as i recall. all you have to do is to add it to the e17 or xfce menu like an app, can't help you there because i only use fluxbox. also i want to mention that the control center is only in full version not in the base one. peace.</div>

<div class="content">As mentioned you need to add the control center and the associated apps to the base. You could also create a .desktop file and it will show up in the xfce menu automatically. See /usr/share/applications for examples and also place the .desktop file there. <br>
<br>
Another option, which is what I did when I used xfce, is create a launcher in the panel. Great for easy access.<br>

By the way, welcome to antiX.</div>

There is a remaster script included in antiX which works perfectly once you have install squashfs-tools from the Debian lenny or Mepis repos.</div>

<div class="content"><span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> WoW! Thanks from everyone for the welcome! I like a nice friendly community. The most important to me for any Linux distro. Or else how can we learn if no one will share. Thanks for thie tips... I do play with Xfce a lot and had considered the launcer idea, but what I needed was to know what it was called... or what I'm looking for. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Thanks ICE -M for that tip. <br>
<br>
SO there is a script? What's it called, is it included in the base? Or only in the full? OR both? Also, how can I grab the control panel for the base if I want to start with that? Though with 'most' of the machines I'm using here or that the students have, a lot of newer laptops, or midrange new laptops, China purposely sits about 6mon to 1yr behind everyone else in the market concerning computers, just now as this year comes to a close 320g and 500g HDD are becoming available on laptops and keep in mind only by one or two sellers. Some namebrands may allow it but it will COST U. <br>
<br>
Back to topic, how to add the control center. Am I guessing right that since some parts of the antiX control center pull or rely on some Mepis GUI/control centers, I would want to add that as well? Though it is usually there as I noted in antiX-base.<br>
<br>
How bout that script? How to start it use it, etc...<br>
<br>
PClin is killing me here. It works great and wonderfully on my system, but then everytime I try to remaster I am running into issues... not sure what it is...<br>
<br>
possibly, likely hardware related. Which is to say, maybe need to redownload everything and reburn. I bought a usb burner and had been burning from my HP but hmmm... not so sure it was really burning well.<br>
<br>
Yes, a section on how to use the remaster script would be wonderful... I'll search it later.<br>
<br>
I am not Chinese by the way. Just over hear teaching English. Been here going on 5yrs now. <br>
<br>
It's... interesting. Just leave it at that. :p</div>
