<div class="content">Hi! USB mounts beautifully. Since i am setting this up for noobs, how to get an icon to appear automagically on desktop when a usb jump drive is inserted, or a CD? (I know, i could put a link to"media" but it's easier for the students this way.)<br>
<br>
Also - how do i mount a floppy, and can i do the same as above? <br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Whoops, I only just noticed this post, sorry for not getting back sooner.<br>
<br>
This is one (easy) way to configure it.<br>
<br>
1. Choose rox-pinboard and panel options (if not already set by default).<br>
2. Plug in usb device<br>
3. Go to where it mounts, I guess media/usb<br>
4. Drag the folder onto the rox-desktop and/or the rox-panel.<br>
5. Open the folder from the desktop or panel.<br>
6. Once finished, it should automount (wait a few seconds say 5), if not try a right-click on the folder and then choose unmount.<br>
7. Unplug usb device.<br>
8. Plugin usb device, wait a few seconds and then hover mouse over the created folders in (4) - a green light should show when it is ready.<br>
9. Click on folder to mount it, and bingo, you are off.<br>
<br>
The settings"should" be saved on a reboot for each user.<br>
<br>
Foer a floppy, you should be able to do the same, though there may be a problem with the floppy not showing up in /media or mount. If that is the case then you will need to create a directory for floppy and link to it in the /etc/fstab file.<br>
<br>
If you are not sure how to do this, post back.<br>
<br>
Now there is a way that rox-desktop can automatically place and remove an icon to the desktop when an external device is plugged in (like kde), but I haven't tried it yet. The information is at the Rox forum.<br>
If you get this working, please post back too.<br>
<br>
enjoy antiX.</div>

<div class="content">Oh good! Thanks for the reply--<br>
<br>
<strong>USB:</strong> OK - I had already discovered what you mentioned about the USB device already and had done just that, plus changing the default folder icon to a USB icon, and it worked perfectly...a pleasant surprise. For the student users, i was wondering if upon plugging in the USB device, can ROX automatically be started? I know this is kinda anethema to Linux, but it's for the school library, not my computer lab. It's not a big deal--i don't mind teaching the students outside class time. I'll check the forums regarding this when i have a little time and post if i find anything.<br>
<br>
<strong>FLOPPY:</strong> I searched around for the floppy drive -- is it fd0?? IDK but i couldn't find anything that would open up anywhere. If you can guide me on making a directory and linking it, that would be great. (Boy, i almost think it would be great if suddenly there WERE no floppies anymore!!! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> )<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah - another question: why are the HDs listed as sda, sdb, instead of the typical hda, hdb? It took me by surprise since i'm used to sda being for a pluggable device, not a hard drive. I'm not complaining, just curious! AnitX is an answer to prayer!!!</div>

<div class="content">Floppy: Yes it is fd0.<br>
<br>
Here we go.<br>
<br>
1. Open rox-filer as root<br>
2. Navigate to media folder and in it create a new folder called floppy<br>
3. Edit /etc/fstab by adding this line to the end:<br>
<br>
/dev/fd0 /media/floppy vfat,ext2 noauto,users,exec,rw 0 0<br>
<br>
(Make sure you add an extra blank line afterwards, otherwise you get an error message).<br>
<br>
4. Click on restart in fluxbox menu and you should now be able to mount a floppy via rox.<br>
<br>
Rox: You can set your computers to have a permanent rox-desktop (and in antiX Lysistrata idesk), by editing the .fluxbox/startup file and removing the # in front of rox or idesk.<br>
Again the rox website has some information as does the antiX website here:<br>

<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
<br>
Oh forgot about the sda part.<br>
Basically it is something like this:<br>
With the 2.6.22 kernel, the names got changed. Now all hardware is sd, the next letter depends on whether it is a primary/secondary drive, a c is for external usb harddrives, a d I think is for cd/dvd etc</div>

<div class="content">OK - i followed your advice as best as i knew how a half-dozen times, but to no avail. <br>
<br>
Here's what i did:<br>
open terminal<br>
type"sux"<br>
enter passsword<br>
type"rox"<br>
navigated to /etc/fstab<br>
From here, i used both leafpad and nano to open the file; i clicked on it and also tried i right-clicking to"open as text" -- i also typed"leafpad /etc/fstab" from the commandline. Anyway, every time i tried and each way i tried i then i entered:<br>
<br>
"/dev/fd0 /media/floppy vfat,ext2 noauto,users,exec,rw 0 0"<br>
or<br>
"/dev/fd0 /media/floppy vfat,ext2 noauto,users,exec,rw 0 0" (with the extra space)<br>
(NOTE: in the above lines,"0" is zero, not the letter O)<br>
i added the extra line and then saved.<br>
Then i checked the file /etc/fstab to make sure the added lines were still there, which they were. Then i rebooted.<br>
<br>
EVERY TIME, the file reverted to what was there before; my added lines simply vanished! Any idea what i am doing wrong?</div>

<div class="content">???<br>
<br>
Ahh, yes, WinKey+D works fine but now another"problem" is apparent. The icons disappear. Let me explain the full mystery...<br>
<br>
At the very first i set up my desktop using WMs&gt;ROX&gt;pinboard and added a few icons to the ones already there (like the CD drive icons that were there by default). Later, when i followed the directions to make the pinboard permanent, i lost my wallpaper and icons and got a blank grey screen."No big deal, i don't need wallpaper," says i, and i proceeded to add new icons, skipping the CD drive icons. BUT i noticed that if i turned the pinboard off AND then back on again, i got back the wallpaper -- with the FIRST set of icons--!??!? Now, upon starting up, i have the grey screen and my second set of icons by default; using WinKey+D, my icons disappear and the wallpaper returns, and if i press WMs&gt;ROX&gt;pinboard again i revert to the first set of icons with wallpaper---<em><strong>?!??!?!?</strong> </em> Oh, yeah, and the wallpaper is unchangeable--i mean, the background image stays the same when i change wallpaper BUT the background image in the menu shows the new wallpaper!<br>
<br>
Now, i am setting all this up for student use on school computers and they DON'T need wallpaper and certainly they can minimize windows manually, so i have all the info i need to get it all up and running to my satisfaction...but all this is a little bizarre--can you explain it? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Perhaps this is all because the very FIRST thing i <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">should</span></strong> have done was make the pinboard permanent?</div>

<div class="content">Here is probably the best way to get rox-desktop up permanently for your students.<br>
<br>
1. In .fluxbox/startup file, uncomment the rox -pinboard=default &amp;<br>
2. Restart X, 'Exit' on menu.<br>
3. You should now login to the grey rox-desktop you saw before.<br>
4. Drag the apps you wish to have on the desktop, changing the icons as described in the antiX howto.<br>
5. Open rox-filer, right click in a space in it, choose options &gt; Compatibility &gt; Check the first option in the list.<br>
6. Restart X and you should now login to your customised rox-desktop. (and it sticks on reboot)<br>
<br>
This process renders the rox option in the fluxbox menu useless, and it is probably best to remove it from the menu.<br>
<br>
Not quite sure whether you will have to do this for each account. I guess you will have to. I also guess that each user will be able to customise their own desktop with their own folders/files etc.<br>
Wallpaper can be customised, but it is a bit tricky.<br>
<br>
An alternative to using rox-desktop is to use idesk (installed in the final, and I think rc2). idesk in some ways is easier to set up, it keeps conky on the desktop, and changing wallpaper is the same as with the default fluxbox desktop. If you google idesk, you'll get lots of help how to set it up.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you again for all your kind help. <br>
<br>
In the comp lab, we use Mepis (3.4.3 at the moment, but hoping to upgrade to 7). The computers generally are heftier and the users are either the computer class students or else kids working on various projects with me nearby. <br>
<br>
The science room and library now have AntiX computers. In these cases i am able to utilize older equipment AND cut down the students' options. Pidgin is totally removed and the only apps shown on the desktop are what they should need -- AbiWord, OpenOffice, Firefox, and maybe GnuChess as the only game. If those savvy enough to right-click and wander around to non-academic diversions decide to do so, it's easy enough for me to edit the menu. The grey screen is actually a good thing--not that i like a colorless world, but the stark blandness subtly reminds them that the computers are here for academics, not for goofing around. They won't be able to play around with the desktops beyond moving the icons around (and i might even take the time to figure out how to lock them in place!); all this plus Linux being virtually virus and spyware-proof by nature -- a real winning combination! <br>
<br>
Mind you, i teach the most wonderful students in the world -- but kids are kids. The science teacher ASKED to JUST have linux on his computer after a student messed around with it, so now there are three of us Linux users on the loose!! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
So i think i'm done with this topic post. THANK YOU again for your good work on AntiX and and your patient answering of my questions. This kind of assistance goes far helping me learn Linux. Thanks for answering me on the other post, too.</div>
