<div class="content">Hello all,<br>
<br>
I am a longtime Mepis user (same screenname on mepislovers.org) and just happened upon a free laptop that is a bit long in the tooth, so I'm now a new antiX user as well. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
I'll be installing antix 7.5 tonight, so I'll post back with my experiences and any problems/questions.<br>

<div class="content">Thanks!<br>

I actually had a chance to start it here at work on my lunch hour, and it didn't go so hot... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
The Live CD portion was great, although the wireless card didn't seem to work...but that can wait. During the Install, the Mepis installer gets to about 50% of copying files to the hard drive and freezes the laptop.<br>
<br>
I realize there isn't any helpful info in this post, but this isn't really the right section anyway. I've got a few ideas to try once I get home, and if I'm still stuck at that point I'll make a new thread in the appropriate section.<br>
<br>
<br>
One quick question though; if I create my own partitions on the drive using gParted, do I have to specifically create a swap partition? I only made two (root and home) the last time the install froze...could the lack of a dedicated swap partition have caused the lockup?<br>

Thanks, I'll look into that. <br>

It's wierd though...the card is mentioned in detail during the bootup process, and both the green status light and orange activity light are on, and an 'ifconfig' shows packets in and out over the card...but opening iceweasel doesn't get out onto the net. I'll try it again at home where the network is less restrictive. If it still isn't working at home, and after trying the mad-wifi drivers, I'll be sure to start a thread.<br>

You mean I have to actually *do* something for antiX to connect to my wireless network? Ugh. And I thought 2008 was the year of Linux on the desktop... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Okay, so I've officially earned my n00b stripes. My card was working all along. I just assumed that the wicd and other wireless tools were for those whose cards weren't recognized on bootup. I am connected and online wirelessly...and am posting this from within antiX! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
<br>
The only oddity now is dealing with the way the drive was partitioned. I went back and specified a swap partition in gparted (actually used 256Mb just to be safe), but to no avail. When I selected 'customize on existing partitions' and clicked next in the Mepis installer, it wouldn't let me choose either partition for the root drive...only 'sda'. So, I went back and told it to use the whole drive and to leave 12Gb free so I could just create my own /home partition later.<br>
<br>
You can imagine my surprise when, after the install was finished (no freeze this time!) I logged in and saw this in gparted:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/3157/antixgpartedyk6.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/3157/antixgpartedyk6.th.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
<br>
The partition layout resembles that which I had tried to use in the install process, plus the 12Gb I specified to be left free at the end. <br>
<br>
<br>
The problem is that I want to either combine my current /home with the empty 12Gb, or delete the current /home and make a new one out of the empty space. But, I can't unmount my /home partition because it says it's busy. I've tried falling back to the command line, logging in as root, but still no luck. Any idea how to unmount /home? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, I'm very (very!) pleased with antiX thus far...I can't wait to tweak this thing out! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
