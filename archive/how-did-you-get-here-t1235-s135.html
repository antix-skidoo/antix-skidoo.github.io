Sorry about your old account getting wiped out. There was a forum clean up and it deleted members who hadn't posted at all or hadn't post for several months. Several 'members' are actually attempts at spamming.<br>
<br>
Latest rc/test version should fix the issues you had.</div>

<div class="content">@ AntiCapitalista:<br>
This is very good distro, Have tried countless times(countless distros) to stick to a linux distro, to stop distro hopping you know, right now using AntiX 11 and very happy at the moment, I hope the next release is good as this one, only one thing anticapitalista, please add if you can support in the disk partitioner to format disk to XFS filesystem, please!<br>
<br>
This is the right way to do partitioning using XFS filesystem:<br>
/boot<br>

The reason I discovered AntiX is my IBM Thinkpad 560X that wouldn't load any other linux distro, other than AntiX. Been a previous user of Crunchbang Linux, so it wasn't really difficult for me to switch for that particular piece of hardware. I have still to fix the sound issue, but this is not a problem of AntiX, rather these old models are notorious with sound being difficult to make them work.<br>

<div class="content">Hello, all.<br>
<br>
First off - thanks to the developers for creating such a fast and well-provisioned system!<br>
<br>
I started with Ubuntu. It was a bit clunky on my P4 2ghz machine, so I've been trying Lubuntu<br>
and Xubuntu which are faster, but still I often get 100% CPU usage when streaming, as there is<br>
no separate graphics card.<br>
<br>
I tried Lubuntu on an old Dell laptop (700mhz /512mb of RAM) and it was acceptable, but then with the advent of 12.04 suddenly any machine with <br>
less than 700mb counts as"low ram" - I had to do a"base" install.<br>
Eventually I ended up with working Lubuntu 12.04 systems on the<br>
desktop and the laptop, but the updates seem to be never-ending, plus I was having problems with update-notification and the updates are getting done when the system feels like it (as opposed to the settings I configured!) So I've got Xubuntu on the desktop, for now.<br>
<br>
I tried the Antix12 live-CD on the desktop - it's blisteringly fast + lower CPU usage - and so I've<br>
installed it on the laptop and am pleased with the results.<br>
<br>
What I was hoping to do next is - install Antix12 on a hard-drive in a caddy, connected by USB<br>
(with the main desktop hard-drive disconnected so I can't mess-up the installation!)<br>
I've done this previously with Lubuntu, as an experiment.<br>
<br>
No doubt I will have lots of dumb questions, as I'm not used to being this much hands-on. <br>
<br>
Thanks, in anticipation.. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>

<div class="content">Glad to hear that you like antiX, Swaphead! The antiX software may require slightly more"hands on" use as you initially get used to it, but the good news is that there are many tools in antiX that help speed up and simplify those tasks, once you learn where they are and how to use them. For example, the Meta Package Installer is handy for setting up whatever window manager or desktop environment you choose to use. The smxi system administration tool is also handy for similar purposes, but is also valuable for managing other package groups as well, and it is excellent for managing system updates, graphical user interfaces, and just about any other system administration need. These two tools are valuable; I'd say that smxi is the number one system management asset to become familiar with.<br>
<br>
In addition to all of this, there are several packaged antiX custom tools. You can remaster (or back up) your system, configure it using antixcc, and there are many other handy tools. We'd be glad to help you out. My first suggestion is to poke around and experiment with as many of them as you need, and ask questions when you encounter problems or you want advice on which tool is most effective to solve a particular problem or most efficiently configure and manage something you are setting up.<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum and to antiX!</div>

<div class="content">From debian unstable/sid family what else? From sidux to aptosid to siduction to semplice and end up in antiX. I'm a big fan of Knoppix since 1.4 although I installed rpm and slackware base distro, debian unstable was my main distro. though antiX was base on debian testing, I read in this forum I could use unstable repo. that was enough for me. thanks for developing this distro. now I could get rid fluxbuntu for good from my system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi. I found out about AntiX while I was looking into lightweight Linux distros. I've used Madbox (Openbox on Ubuntu), then Fluxmint which was a bit lighter because of the Fluxbox desktop. I wanted something a bit faster than Fluxmint - excellent though it is - because I was trying to get the most out of an old Toshiba Satellite cdt 4070 laptop which only has 366mhz processor, and (upgraded) 192 Ram. Antix 12 runs well on this, and to my surprise even manages to load Libreoffice 3.5 well enough. Antix detected all my hardware, including usb stick wireless, wireless card, and mobile dongle recently got from 3. All I needed to do to get my screen to display correctly, was to add an xorg.conf file specifically adjusted to work with the Trident graphics card. <br>
<br>
AntiX has worked so well at making the most of very old hardware, that I've now switched to using it on all my computers. I can even play video files so long as I do it in the terminal window using mplayer.<br>
<br>
I am typing this using an old HP Omnibook XE2 which I picked up for under £10, I added max Ram to 256meg and put in 60gig harddrive, and it works great with AntiX too. AntiX is so easy on system resources that the cooling fan hardly ever gets activated. <br>
<br>
It is this kind of experience which causes me to stick with lightweight linuxes. It should not be necessary to be regularly be buying expensive hardware to have a reasonabley functional computer for non-graphics intensive use.<br>
<br>
Thank you for AntiX!</div>

<br>
Thanks for the welcome! Yes, just love to have computers last a very long time. I had a new HP laptop which died after two years, so now I prefer to get used, old, preferably quality equipement, and try and make the most of it. I've thought for a long time it should not take a really powerful computer to have something that's good with text, still graphics, and audio, and that is reasonably quick. Just love the fact that with open source stuff you've got real choice regarding how graphically intensive you want your Desktop to be. <br>
<br>
I love that in Antix it is easy to install for newbies and invites involvement with the commandline and console applications, for example, by editing slim.conf to get it present with the password field on login rather than requesting username. I've found vim and vifm extremely worthwhile to get a handle on, as well as various console apps such as mplayer. I hope to really increase my facility with Linux by making the most of Antix and the commandline.<br>
<br>
Again, thanks for the welcome and also the two links at the bottom of your post.<br>
Cheers from Antixity in Hampshire, South East England</div>

anything else, such as good looking bikes, or good looking people draped all over them, we leave that up to Roky to take care of! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
In any case, glad to have you here.<br>
<br>
Curiously enough, this evening, I am running a persistent Live instance of a distro that we've cleverly acquired some of their good technology: I happen to be running the brand new release of Puppy Linux 5.4, the"Precise Puppy" release, and it's a good one. I have a 512 MB persistent disk image created on my /dev/sda8 partition, which happens to be where I also house the main system that I use to control the MBR on this hardware. Not surprisingly, it is also Debian-based, my own custom implementation of Debian Sid. That system is extremely close to what I have also replicated in my own antiX core custom distro. All of them are EXTREMELY good!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks masinick for the welcome! Yes it's great that there is the freedom to do all sorts of adaptations and hacks with Linux. I remember sometime ago using a piece of windows software and wanting to export a recipe as an HTML document, and there not being an option to do this. In linux you can get under the skin of it and edit text files to make things work more how you would like them to, and you have simple tools to modify files. Last night I was able to extract the audio from a flash file by using ffmpeg commandline tool.</div>

Yes, that is precisely the reason why many people look for something else. Actually, in the most recent versions of Windows, a lot has improved, and you can be certain that Apple's OS X (UNIX-based) and Linux had something to do with that. These days, even Windows has powerful tools, such as Power Shell, which really is a rather powerful shell. There are also complete command line environments, ported to Windows from UNIX and Linux-based environments.<br>
<br>
One thing that neither Apple or Microsoft environments provide, however, is the software freedom, including both the availability of source code, for those who really want to tinker and modify, and the free cost found in many (though not all) Linux systems. You can get source code that will run on OS X and Windows, but guess where THAT comes from? Of course, it is the free software from GNU projects started with UNIX systems in the eighties and Linux systems in the nineties.<br>
<br>
No matter what you do, it's virtually impossible to get the ease and flexibility you find with software like that found in antiX. It is free in cost, free in what you are able to think and do, and while some implementations give you plenty to start with, you are free to change it as much as you like. Even in the Linux space, few systems are as flexible as antiX is, at least immediately, with the tools that are provided. In that regard, antiX only has a few other systems (also Linux-based) that approach it).</div>
