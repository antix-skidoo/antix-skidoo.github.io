<div class="content">Setting up an irc channel is very trivial. Anyone can make a channel on most servers with a few commands.<br>
<br>
Reclaiming that dead one on irc would involve getting a friendly irc cop on freenode to release it or change the founder. Or there is the option of just use a diffrent irc server. Freenode though is used by many in the open source world and would be a logical place.<br>
<br>
What's harder is getting support for it via this website or other avenues so that people are aware of it's existant. A chat room with three people would work but thirty would be better. For example, preconfiguring the distro's chat program(s) to go directly to the chat room would be one method of creating awareness as I think secipolla was suggesting.</div>

<div class="content">Ok here is an update on freenode.<br>
<br>
The policy is #antix should be given to someone in the antix community that is an"official" representative. They don't have a problem releasing the channel if someone from antix request this.<br>
<br>
The channel ##antix would be for users and unoffical. I have registered the channel under one of my irc nicknames"Metatron" I will try to leave it up and running. I would hand it off if someone wanted it.<br>
<br>
This is a meager start. If anyone is interesed point your irc client to irc.frenode.net and join ##antix.<br>
<br>
I have been using antix for around 2 years, but I don't know the people running the show. If someone"in chanrge" would like to give some input that would be great. In the mean time I'll park in ##antix.<br>
<br>
Here is an url that will take you to the chat room IF you have a irc server and your system configured to handle this mime type, (I think it is a mime type, might just be a protocol handler in the browser) : [url]irc://irc.freenode.net/##antix[/url]</div>

Paul, a.k.a. anticapitalista,"runs the show" here, as far as having the ownership to antiX. He is quite reasonable and listens to feedback. ou812 is one who sometimes helps him out and there are others in the community, but anti really is the one who makes final decisions - not sure that there has ever been anyone else (but there could be, from my perspective, suggestions here are generally considered).<br>
<br>
But did you know that at the top of this forum there actually is an integrated"chat" feature? You can use it at any time. That may be why other chats have been dormant.</div>

<div class="content">Ok, I PM'ed with anticapitalista and he said go for it. I have filled out the paper work for freenode and I am awaiting a reply.<br>
<br>
I'm testing an eggdrop bot to handle various stuff. Right now it's running on my antix box. If anyone knows where I could get a shell account to run it out of, it would add more security. ATM, it doesn't do much but sit there. I've never used it before and there is a learning curve.<br>
<br>
It might even be needed as the ChanServ is pretty good at security. But maybe I could get it to provide info blurbs for common problems, handle spam, add extra flood and takeover control and perhaps spout some debian or linux rss feeds to the channel.<br>
<br>
I have three computers logged into #antix and ##antix to make it look like there people...<span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Don't freak if no one talks.<br>
