<div class="content">Once again, a great collection. I tend to like the ones that have a moderate amount of medium colors, not too bright, but not dark either. I do appreciate your artistic talent, though, even in the ones that don't have my favorite color schemes. In today's group, I especially like LightsTheHeart and Grislabro, but I went back and looked at several pages of the work and I like the creativity throughout. There are a handful of others that I have.<br>
<br>
Until the server started blocking me, I was putting quite a few of them in the"My Pictures" folder beneath"My Documents" on my XP system at work, but I have not been able to do so this week. I will most certainly be collecting a number of these fine works so I have desktop variety on AntiX to go with the fine work that the guys have already put together.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed looking at some of the abstract stuff too. Keep up that creativity. Whether they end up on my desk or not, I enjoy looking at all of them and appreciate your work!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks again, Sakasa! I found out that the issue of being"banned" from viewing the latest wallpapers seems to be a function of using my work laptop on the corporate network through VPN and a firewall. I can consistently access the wallpapers from my home systems, but while I used to be able to access and download the wallpapers on my work system, that is where I get the banned messages. I am not being prevented from accessing the server from the corporate network. If that were the case, I would get a company page saying that accessing the particular page is against company policy.<br>
<br>
Oh well, guess I will have to restrict myself to downloading these fine wallpapers on my home systems only - too bad - I had been putting together a very nice wallpaper and pictures collection in"My Pictures" on the work system - something to brighten up the usual stuff.<br>
<br>
Keep up the great work, Sakasa! We clearly appreciate one another's efforts - I sure appreciate yours! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

To let you know I have this server ban from my site I yes want to know if you are at this server? The name is: geo.sp1 .hostingprod.com to geo.sp18 .hostingprod.com.<br>
<br>
This server has try and try to spam my site but it is already ban completely from it. If this is the case then you can send me your IP address and I will allow you in from your work. I am sorry about the issue at your work. Maybe you can download the images putting into a usb and set these up at your work?<br>
<br>
Well let me know if this is your case.<br>

<div class="content">I am not using either of the IP addresses that you mention. I will have to get in touch with you to share where I am getting in. My ISP is Comcast, and it works from home, but when I come in over VPN through the company resources or I am in the office, that is when I see the banned message. I will find your Email address and send you a note later.<br>

Brian</div></blockquote>Most employers do not accept downloading to their business websites. Due for security reasons like viruses and this could be the issue. Maybe you only download wallpapers but others could download zips, mp3, etc..<br>
<br>
This could it be the reason for your situation or that before was one way and now the employer could it make a change of his mind.<br>

<div class="content">As I mentioned in one of the other posts, the issue seems to be accessing my work network through a VPN - Virtual Private Network. If I access the work network directly I can save stuff normally; work is not blocking me, it's the VPN that's doing it. Comcast is not blocking me, either; I can save images from my home system. So I figured out the culprit - will have to get this stuff when I am NOT on the VPN!<br>
<br>
Thanks. This is one of my favorite collections of all, at or near the top of my list of the work that you have done. Very good!</div>
