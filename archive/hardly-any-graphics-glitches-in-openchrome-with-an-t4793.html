<div class="content">I would like to understand why my VGA in AntiX-full (13.2) works much better, than when I start with AntiX-core (13.1). I would like to know, so that I could start with core and make a working system.<br>
<br>
I read that the VIA CN700 graphics hardware on my mainboard is known to have timing problems. I never noticed any trouble, though, for years, in squeeze and earlier. I genereally started with AntiX-core, and installed xorg and xfce4. With wheezy I began noticing glitchy rectangles, in the GUI session. In jessie they were so bad I couldn't use it. (The driver is xserver-xorg-video-openchrome.)<br>
<br>
I happened to notice that the 13.2 live cd, running on that computer, did not produce video glitches. So I installed from that, and added XFCE. Even after upgrading to testing, I have practically never seen a glitchy rectangle. Maybe just once or twice, momentarily. What could be different?</div>

<div class="content">Just a wild guess, Window manager startup scripts?<br>
<br>
I have not done a core in stall since version 8.5 so I have no recent experience with the current core installer. <br>
I kinda avoid Debian stable when I can since I am a edgy kind of biker.<br>

The laptop in question has intel graphics and has been regulated to the shelf as I have more modern/old atom netbooks that took it's place<br>
as my saddlebag computer. It never exhibited the glitches you mention but intel graphics and core 8.5 is like comparing apple to oranges<br>
in your case. I also ran fluxbox in my core with LXpanel instead of XFCE like you did.<br>
<br>
Maybe Brian M. will read this thread and have a better explanation as he runs XFCE in his core install.<br>

<div class="content">Thanks, Rok, good idea! I check those startup scripts.<br>
A while ago I read that developers consider these C7 graphics a pita, because they don't tell you when they're done updating, or something like that. Maybe the recent X11 versions have speeded up the graphics and exposed troubles. And maybe in AntiX full there's a startup script turning down the vga acceleration.<br>

That does sound like a good saddlebook.</div>
