<div class="content">I've been away from antiX Linux for a few years but have recently tried it again (and installed it on my laptop PC), and it's much better. Codec/driver support seems to have improved. (DVD playing works out of the box now. I was unable to play DVDs in antiX Linux in the past.) I also like the new Debian Stable base of antiX Linux.<br>
<br>
In other words, antiX Linux has addressed the reasons I switched to other distros. I switched from antiX Linux to Linux Mint Debian Edition, because the latter had better codec/driver support. I switched to Debian-based Snowlinux, but it didn't seem to offer anything (besides a newer ISO) that LMDE didn't.<br>
<br>
My most recent main distro has been Crunchbang Linux for the low-maintenance Debian Stable base. I never liked the default setup, but adding the LXDE package can give it the look and feel of antiX Linux, Puppy Linux, and Linux Mint.<br>
<br>
I'm curious: How is antiX Linux able to include the Xfce desktop AND LibreOffice, yet still have an ISO file small enough for a CD? LibreOffice is known for being heavy, and the new Xfce desktop has to be significantly heavier than the old IceWM + ROX Pinboard desktop.</div>

I assume you are talking about MXlinux. Its magic. Part of it was better file system compression. Part of it is there is only 1 of everything (1 file manager, 1 music player, 1 video player). Java is left off the most current iso to make some room. antiX actually comes with more apps in terms of count, but they tend to be smaller in size and scope.<br>
<br>
but mostly its anti's magic.</div>
