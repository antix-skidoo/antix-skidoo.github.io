<div class="content">Hi All,<br>
<br>
I am working on improving the graphical interface for the RemasterCC suite of scripts by using GtkDialog instead of yad. So far, it's looking good but I have had no feedback from Anti about this.<br>
<br>
I don't want to waste my and megatotoro's time with translations as happened with the snapshot-gui-mx for MX-14.3 which was changed significantly for 14.4.<br>
<br>
I can improve the English grammar which will make it not only easier to read but also to translate to other languages.<br>
<br>
It appears that translations are incomplete for persist-config and that there are no translations for antiX-common.sh. Next on my agenda will be remaster-live, persist-save and persist-makefs.<br>
<br>
I've also found some coding (typographical) errors that need correcting and someone will have to volunteer to test all these changes in order to make sure I haven't inadvertently broken anything because my experience, with the use of this suite of scripts, is nil.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Michael.</div>

<div class="content">Michael, I just upgraded all of those programs. The translations for antiX-common.sh and the other libraries are in the antix-bash-libs resource on the transifex site. Earlier today I posted a 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://forum.mepiscommunity.org/viewtopic.php?p=361662#p361662"<br>linktext was:"a list"<br>====================================<br>
 of programs that need updated translations.<br>
<br>
I wish I had known earlier that you were interested in working on this stuff. I have a ton of work to do to get antiX-15 out the door and I could have used the help. Those libraries are definitely way overdue for a rewrite. Maybe we can work on this after antix-15 is released and my schedule frees up a little.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry there was a communication breakdown. OTOH, it should not be too surprising that we were revamping these programs for the first major release in almost 2 years. Part of the communication problem was the"RemasterCC" in the title of your posts because (1) remasterCC is not my code and (2) it was dropped from antiX-15. I don't have the time to track down every post on the forums to check and see if it might involve what I'm working on. <br>
<br>
Again, I'm sorry about the communication breakdown. I finally read your post above after following your link in the translations thread.</div>

<div class="content">Hi BitJam,<br>
<br>
Thanks for responding!<br>
<br>
Are you the person whom I should always contact regarding translations for antiX and MX?<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>BitJam wrote:</cite>Michael, I just upgraded all of those programs.</div></blockquote>
I will take a look at them and let you know if I think any corrections are in order.<br>
<br>
Whilst waiting for a response to my topics I have been working on completing and improving the Spanish translations for luckyBackup 0.4.8 as well as rephrasing and correcting some of the English to make it easier to understand and translate. I am in communications with Loukas for this.<br>
<br>
With whom should I be liasing for antix2usb (Live USB)? I have sent PMs to Anti but I have not received a response. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
What has replaced RemasterCC in antiX-15?<br>
<br>
Can it be used in MX14.4?<br>
<br>
I have looked at 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/antix-development/resources/"<br>linktext was:"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/an ... resources/"<br>====================================<br>
 and I see the following entries for RemasterCC.<br>
<br>
PO remaster.pot Uncategorized 778 words (80 strings) May 8th, 12:53 pm<br>
PO remastercc.sh Uncategorized 8 words (3 strings) May 4th, 11:02 am<br>
<br>
Are these entries now obsolete and should they be removed from Transifex?<br>
<br>
Are all the entries, I see in Transifex, pertinent to antiX-15?<br>
<br>
These translations I have been working on are for the MX-14.4 I will be installing on the old Pentium 4 desktop I have previously posted about. I was thinking that the same work could be used for antiX also.<br>
<br>
megatotoro has completed the addition of 2 strings for the Page menu of Simple Scan. It was a simple learning exercise for him. <br>
<br>
Other applications he and I will be working on are the following which include some notes I made for myself.<br>

<br>
We have talked repeatedly about setting up a antiX/MX native application database with info on developer, maintainer, etc., but it has not happened yet.</div>
