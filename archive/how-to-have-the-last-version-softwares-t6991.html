<div class="content">My last install was Antix 13-2 (years ago). I use the"testing" &amp;"nosystemd" repos and set for"rolling release", and update stuff nearly daily via Synaptic / apt-get and have all the latest stuff. I NEVER NEVER use apt-get dist-upgrade (often BREAKS things for others), but prefer to PICK my updates individually in Synaptic (excluding updates that will pull in libsystemd0, and most of those that end in"-b#","alpha" or"beta" or"git" ("beta quality") and have a few things"pinned" that I know will cause me grief. I almost NEVER have any issues or have to roll anything back! Synaptic will also show you if an update will pull in dependencies and allow you to accept them or decline. You can also view the"changelog" for individual packages too!</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>There is no softwares library like inside Ubuntu?</div></blockquote>
Synaptic Package Manager (accessed via your desktop menu, or via antiX ControlCenter)<br>
plenty of video tutorials are available<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=synaptic+package+manager"<br>linktext was:"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_ ... ge+manager"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>update and dist-upgrade are for the linux OS softwares ,if I thing right?</div></blockquote>
"update" only retrieves an up-to-date list of available packages (equivalent to"Reload" button in Synaptic toolbar)<br>
<br>
"dist-upgrade" installs updated versions of any packages which are already installed on your system.<br>

Sorry but I'm unsure I can digest all that.<br>
<br>
"leafpad 0.8.18.1 on my PC, to 0.8.18.1-3"<br>
^-------- you can read the changelog -----} 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/l/leafpad/leafpad_0.8.18.1-3_changelog"<br>linktext was:"http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/c ... _changelog"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
FWIW, I skimmed the changelog and found nothing significant. No new features, no earth-shattering bugfixes...<br>
<br>
"Evince not in AntiX I installed in 2014, and I downloaded it myself 3.4 , and I like to up to 3.4.0-3.1 now"<br>

<br>
read the changelog &amp; decide whether there's an important reason to upgrade?<br>
<br>
"and the other softwares installed in the first ISO"<br>
"Is there a tool who do that for all, SMXI"<br>
quickest way would be to command <span style="color: green">sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</span><br>
<br>
"Do I have to remove the old softwares before install the newest,one by one."<br>
No, uninstall first is not necessary.<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Could you give me some informations or where to learn</div></blockquote>
Starting point would be (and would have been, back in 2014) the antiX docs+faq available from"Help" in your desktop menu</div>

<div class="content">Using the ideas from wildstar84 is one way to go. As long as you use the"testing" &amp;"nosystemd" repos (these are the files in the '/etc/apt" directory) then you should be able to keep the system current.<br>
<br>
We also have antiX 16.1, which is much newer, that will allow you to have more current software, whether you use the 'testing" repo to keep it up to date or you simply use the"stable" repo and update periodically. antiX-15 is a bit older, so you wouldn't want to use it at this point unless you set it up with the"testing" &amp;"nosystemd" repos as suggested for antiX 13.2.<br>
<br>
The mere fact that antiX is so flexible is a plus; you don't HAVE to constantly install new versions of the system - as long as you are willing to use the"rolling release" style with the"testing" &amp;"nosystemd" repos. But to understand what all of this means does take a bit of knowledge; otherwise you're either blindly doing activities without understanding them or you miss important factors in maintaining a solid, secure system. There are a lot of reading resources available and the team generally suggests the ones that make the most sense to understand.<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://mxlinux.org/wiki/all"<br>linktext was:"https://mxlinux.org/wiki/all"<br>====================================<br>
 is one place to get more information and it's reasonably well organized by topic.<br>
<br>
If you're unsure where to look for information or you do not understand specific sections of documentation, or you simply want to double-check your understanding, most people here are patient enough to read, listen, and answer, as long as you also demonstrate that you have done your best to read and understand what is already available. But we can at times help you find"available" information when you're confused about where to look for information on a specific topic.<br>
<br>
Roky is often"our bud" in this regard. He may also amuse you and make you laugh with his comments; he's a great guy and generally very helpful.<br>
<br>
I hope that this summary and these suggestions prove helpful to you and others who may wonder how to update software appropriately.</div>
