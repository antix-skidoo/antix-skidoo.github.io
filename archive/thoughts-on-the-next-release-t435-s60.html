<div class="content">Just a thought, but what would it take to add an"Install to USB" option? The reason for asking is that many distros now have this option (As well as Live CD Remastering etc) and as USB sticks are becoming ever cheaper, and are FAR more flexible than CD's, it's a good way to carry your"Portable antiX" around with you!<br>
<br>
Is it feasible or would it just create too many other problems and/or take up too much space?</div>

<div class="content">The install to usb will be for the future (I hope)<br>
<br>
Actually there is an install to usb script included in preview1 (and M7.2) in /usr/local/bin called grml2usb. It needs working on for antiX, but I did manage to successfully install an antiX.iso file to a usb stick running like a livecd, but changes are not saved on reboot.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the info anti. I may have a look at the script &amp; give it a try, but i don't hold out much hope of it working.... i still have much to learn &amp; many things are WAY beyond me! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Great to hear that it's earmarked for a future release though. <br>

By the way, i noticed that the script is named"grml".... is it taken from the grml distro at all? (just curious)</div>

<div class="content">Yes it is from grml distro.<br>
<br>
I tried the script in the latest sidux, but it didn't work. The grml script, though it is for grml, is meant to be fairly generic.<br>

If it doesn't work and you want to install antiX to a usb device as a livecd, then I know how to do it.</div>

Thanks for the info anti.... grml is a great release isn't it? (Could it be called a"Distro" as such?) <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> If i decide to have a go at the anti-usb i'll let you know.

<br>
In the meantime, you may want to take a look at the latest lxde 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://lxde.sourceforge.net/"<br>linktext was:"http://lxde.sourceforge.net/"<br>====================================<br>
 release. It's using the latest version (RC) of PCmanFM which is not in the sid repos yet, but i've already installed it on my Linux Mint setup to try it out, and it's pretty good. Very well laid out, uses OpenBox as the WM, and seems to have everything that's needed. <br>
<br>
Even if you don't want to use it for a future release, it's definitely worth a look.... VERY slick! I'll have more of a play &amp; let you know how it goes.<br>
<br>
I'm currently trying to install it on antiX (The lxde components are in the repos but not PCmanFM) but i'm having trouble getting PCmanFM compiled.... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

<div class="content">The strange thing is I added the lxde sid repos on one box and everything installed fine. On another box, I got an error re the version of pcmanfm. I searched the ubuntu forums and found a .deb file. After installing it, I was able to install lxde from the repos. Also, I searched the dreamlinux forums and found a link to the lxappearance app and installed that. It is like switch, but has many more features. (They also suggested installing lxde-common.)<br>
<br>
But starting an lxde session was difficult: I had to edit slim, xinitrc, create an LXDE.session file, and create an lxde startup script (making it executable) and copy it to /usr/bin. Even after all of this, I found some bugs: lxappearance did not fully preview the features of the gtk2 themes. Also, I couldn't change the styles of ob - the file seemed to be located in / and therefore wasn't accessible. I couldn't figure out how to address this problem and so I simply ran openbox with lxpanel (I was pretty bummed as I wanted a session manager). Unfortunately, this wasn't that great either. For example, when trying to edit the prefs of lxpanel, the background image made the ui unreadable. If these issues get ironed out, I may be tempted to start with the antix base, make lxde (with ob) the default wm, add most of anti's apps, and add a few kde components: less lean and more mean. Let me know if you want to work together on solving the lxde issues. Thanks.<br>

Hmmm, that's strange. I had the same problems with PCmanFM, so i downloaded the latest release &amp; compiled locally, which went well once i'd installed a few missing deps etc. I did also install the LXDE package on my Linux Mint (Daryna) install on another machine, and that went superbly well, and works fine. ??<br>
<br>
I also installed on Xubuntu &amp; that went without hitch as well, so it was only the antiX install that i had to do some work on. But it was fun &amp; i learned a lot in the process, so it's kool! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I never even thought of looking in the DreamLinux forums.... nice thinking! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

Wow!! I never had that much hassle..... don't know why. All i did was edit the slim.conf as usual, then add"startlxde" to .xinitrc, and that was that...... it fires up fine!! That's on this antiX 7.01 P1 using sid. I didn't do any of that other stuff that you mention. <br>

When i first installed i didn't bother with any external files, and just installed the package stuff from the repos (lxde, lxde-common and the relevant openbox stuff.... oh, plus PCmanFM once i'd got it done). It was only today that i downloaded the source files and most of them threw up errors so i didn't bother chasing them any further as i've already got lxde working OK. <br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I couldn't figure out how to address this problem and so I simply ran openbox with lxpanel (I was pretty bummed as I wanted a session manager). </div></blockquote>
Ah, i did install the xfce session manager for some reason..... can't remember why now. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Openbox with LXpanel works quite well though doesn't it...... but it's not as good as the LXDE complete. <br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Unfortunately, this wasn't that great either. For example, when trying to edit the prefs of lxpanel, the background image made the ui unreadable. </div></blockquote>
Yep, that black background makes a mess of it, but if you go into PCmanFM and just use the system theme, it all gets cleared up and looks fine...... see my blog for a screenie of LXDE

That sounds like a GREAT idea, and i'm up for it completely. antiX is definitely a superb base to use, and i really love both Openbox and LXDE, so yeah, combined with some great apps it could be a worthwhile project.<br>
<br>
What sort of KDE apps? I'm not a heavy KDE user so don't know too much about it, BUT.... I really LOVE Konqueror and use it a lot, whatever distro i use, because it's just so good. I really like the whole tabbed browsing thing, and also the way that it takes care of samba/file sharing without any hassle! <br>

That's a good idea. Making the most out of what comes with the KDE base will at least keep the size down. Does Amarok come with the base? <br>

Decisions indeed...... after much mucking about i finally got the KDE Lite installed in V-Box, but it took me ages to find the KDE version of Synaptic (Kpackage)..... Duh!! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Man, KDE is an ugly behemoth! I much prefer Fluxbox, Gnome, Openbox etc..... but hey, that's part of what makes Linux so much fun eh...? All those extra decisions! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
It's not running too well at the moment, but that could be down to me not being to knowledgeable with regards to V-Box..... i'm getting there though. Early days &amp; all that.<br>
<br>
Couldn't find LXDE in the repos though..... maybe i need to enable sid?<br>

<div class="content">anti - a couple of quickies that you may find interesting.... <br>
<br>
1: The new version of 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.grafpup.org"<br>linktext was:"GrafPup"<br>====================================<br>
 (v2.01) is out and it's well worth looking at if you get the chance. (
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.bubbleletter.org/downloads/"<br>linktext was:"Download from here"<br>====================================<br>
)<br>
<br>
Nathan's put together a fine package once again and there could be a few things that may be worth using in antiX at some point. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Apart from that it's worth downloading anyway because it's really small (about 100mb) and is a handy iso to have hanging around on a CD-RW etc.<br>
<br>
2: I also came across 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://tcdr.sourceforge.net/"<br>linktext was:"this cool app"<br>====================================<br>
 that you may find interesting.<br>
<br>
<strong>TCDR is a menu-driven console frontend for CD recording</strong><br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://tcdr.sourceforge.net/manual.html#Packages"<br>linktext was:"Here's a link"<br>====================================<br>
 to the manual page as well. It describes in more detail what it does &amp; what apps etc it works as a front end for.<br>
<br>
It's console based, very light &amp; looks really useful, plus it does everything from Audio CD's to Boot CD,s, Wav's, MP3's etc. I'm going to give it a try this weekend just to see what it works like etc.... i'll let you know.</div>
