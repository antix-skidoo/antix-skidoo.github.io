<div class="content">Been trying to keep you in the game bro. Just hang in there. You won't have to reinstall since we have no end of life in Debian testing. Once you get in tune with Debian, Icewm, Fluxbox,JWM, or whatever you prefer. You will become a happy camper like me.<br>

Besides, we here are cool ass bros.</div>

I really wish I had discovered it long ago. It just has to be the greatest distro ever. Thanks for all the work you guys have put into it.<br>

<div class="content">Yes, I like it as well - on my Dell Netbook. It's more like the old DOS programmes (WordPerfect 5.1) which took me a while to master but, once I had mastered, would draw my bath, make, butter &amp; marmelade my toast, lay out my days wardrobe and send me on my way rejoicing!<br>
<br>
Happy days.<br>

As AntiCapitalista says -"takes a while to get used to" - but fast on a low powered machine &amp; a great learning vehicle.</div>

<div class="content">In the back of my mind I perceive AntiX as being the" Unleashed" linux distro! I say that because<br>
most of the distros I have recently looked at try to" herd" their users in a set direction. For example<br>
Ubuntu 12.04 and Suse 12.2 gnome feel like a" corral" where users are" forced ' to use the things<br>
the distro makers want them to do. The chromium browser is available in AntiX but it is not being <br>
forced down anyone's throat. I've never liked Firefox and have always used Seamonkey. If<br>
Seamonkey was not available I did not want to be bothered. In ubuntu 12 I had to install a synaptic <br>
package manager because I could not use the installed package until i joined something.<br>
<br>
The are Linux distro's for the proffessionals who can write their own code; but for us inept users<br>
we have to rely on the mindset of the developers to respect our liberty! Thanks AntiX!!</div>

For sure,"Cousin"! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I first became interested in antiX as soon as I heard about it, back in 2006. I liked it then because it was lean and fast, but it's taken on many different forms and flavors since then. The"Full" Version of antiX, while still pretty light, lean, and fast compared to most of its competition, has at least tripled in the size of the ISO image, which, if I remember correctly, used to be between 150-200 MB at first. That's not the fault entirely of antiX; software continues to grow, though it is partially because we have added more software and we have many more language translations than we had in the early days, so that tends to take up space.<br>
<br>
We compensated for those things, first, by adding a"Base" version, that still included a graphical user interface, but removed most of the application software, allowing the tinkerers among us to select the software we wanted to use. I started experimenting with both the Full and the Base versions, and found that you can get what you want either way, starting Full and then removing and adding software, but Base was a bit easier to get exactly what you wanted. We went further than that when we created the Core Edition; that starts with only the guts of the system, no graphical user interface at all, no applications, only the system kernel, the core system utilities, and the tools for constructing your system.<br>
<br>
By having three unique approaches, we can target somewhat different audiences and user bases, and both anti and the community have done a great job in communicating and putting in place the software and tools that are most helpful for constructing what the community wants to do.<br>
<br>
Clearly, for someone who wants to plug something in and go, perhaps our parent systems, MEPIS (and in a more hands on way, its parent, Debian) tend to include more software. PCLinuxOS rivals MEPIS; the two of them are both really good 'plug it in and go" systems. Others like Mint also appeal strongly to those who prefer to grab something and use it unchanged. We're very different from those systems. All of them are good at what they do best. We're one of the best at providing the tools and the infrastructure for making whatever you want; Puppy, Tiny Core, SLAX, and SliTAZ are four other systems that take a somewhat different approach, but have a few things in common with us; we've taken things from Puppy and Absolute Linux in the past (and probably other systems, too). We don't have to invent everything; that's what's so nice about free software: you can mix and match, share and reuse, and the result are thousands of different systems, each of which is suited to a somewhat different audience. We do well with our audience, in my opinion.</div>
