<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I have seen the registration at the wiki is closed because of spammers. I would like to share what I did to avoid doing so on some places I manage. At beginning when we started with our own forum, we had lots of spammers to hunt each day. The forum has both French and English sections, so I could not use a captcha that asks things just in English, or just in French. I had to find something else, which led me to a search on the web, where I found a page talking about several"unusual captchas", very interesting! Some looked hard to solve, some not so much. All were funny. I chose Keycaptcha which seamed interesting to me.<br>
<br>
I have installed Keycaptcha on the Linuxvillage forum many months ago, and since then I almost never had a spammer registering (their registration is moderated anyway). Let's say, in one year, I have had 3 or 4 of them, I guess they registered manually.<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.keycaptcha.com/captcha-for-cms/"<br>linktext was:"https://www.keycaptcha.com/captcha-for-cms/"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
This is what I use. It's effective and doesn't prevent people from different countries, using different languages, to use it. The only issue would be for disabled people? But is closing registration better?<br>
<br>
This is the list where I chose:<br>

<br>
<br>
Here more ideas:<br>

<br>
<br>
I hope these ideas can help. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
