<div class="content">Just installed 7.5 on sdb and got an error at boot so I'm running Mepis 7.0 at the moment to get joined up and say Hello!. I'm a halfbreed Osage Indian/American living at the foot of the FlintHills in the center of Kansas in the center of the US on land stolen from my ancestors that I get to pay tax to Kansas for. I'm pretty computer saavy but not enough to keep myself from crashing the works now and then. I've used Mepis since 2004 and go by JBoman on mepislovers and cowonjolt here and on SBLinux forum. I've had unresolved hardware problems on mepis since 7.0 that I did not have with mepis 3.4.3; so, since I still like to print something once in awhile, and take and share pictures, I'm giving antiX a serious try. Take care, cowonjolt <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Welcome to this lite side of Mepis, cowonjolt. <br>
Hey, not only was the land stolen and you have to rent it back, but didn't they steal the resources too ie oil or was elsewhere in Kansas?<br>
<br>
Anyhow, post your problem and we'll see if we can get it fixed.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome from another half breed(Mississauga/Canadian) to the world of Antix. I'm also pay those very same taxes on stolen land!<br>
<br>
Maybe you heard of the big offensive taking place in my area. The Mohawks from the Six Nations Reserve have taken over land the was being developed in Caledonia ON. They have also enforced there rights to be involved in the permit process for any development 6 miles either side of the Grand River from it's start to the mouth(Their treaty land"given" to them after fighting the Americans, Reference's: Joseph Brant). This has stopped or delayed a lot of building in my area.<br>
<br>
Any way, Welcome.<br>
<br>
More reading if your are interested.<br>

Welcome to antiX, cowonjolt! I find both SimplyMEPIS and antiX to be great distributions, and the four systems I have, (two desktops and two laptops) each work great with both systems. More and more, though, I am excited by what is happening in the antiX community, especially following the recent release!<br>
<br>
eriefisher, is the area of Mississauga where you live anywhere near as industrialized as either Hamilton or Burlington? My last trip over toward Toronto has not been since 2002, but just a few weeks ago, I came across New York at Niagara Falls and took the QEW up to 403, then went west to 401, went as far as London, then took 402 to Sarnia, before crossing into Michigan at Port Huron, on my way to see my mom in Clinton Township, Michigan, northeast of Detroit.<br>
<br>
There are some beautiful farming communities in Ontario, especially near London, Ontario, but the area between Buffalo, NY and Toronto, Ontario holds no interest for me. In fact, on my return trip, I drove further south through northern Ohio just to AVOID it! I am sure that part of my experience was due to road construction, and part of it was due to the abundant availability of hydro-electric power, which seems to fuel a lot of heavy industry in the area. Hope your community is more hospitable than the ones I went through on the QEW between Niagara Falls and the 403.<br>
<br>
Also, where is the"Grand River"? I know, of course, of the Niagara River going through the area and Lake Ontario, but offhand, I can not think of the"Grand River" - unless that is another name for the Niagara River - a very powerful and grand river indeed? (In Michigan, there is a city just off Lake Michigan called Grand River, and there is a river by that name that roughly runs between Lansing and the Grand River areas in Michigan, but I am not familiar with a river by the same name in south central Ontario. Could you enlighten me please?</div>

<div class="content">Mississauga is the name of my people and also the name of a city on the east side of Toronto which is named for those people, now displaced. I grew up in Hamilton but moved out of the city when I was about 19, that was about .......... years ago. <br>
<br>
The Grand River starts about 2 hours north of London and finishes in Dunnville/Port Maitland on Lake Erie, which is where I live now. It's about 45-60 minutes west of Niagara Falls.<br>
<br>
If you make that trip again I would recommend traveling hwy #3 instead of the major routes. It's a much nicer drive and really doesn't take anymore time. You can catch #3 in Fort Erie, across the river from Buffalo and take it all the way to Windsor. You actually had to cross the Grand on you trip, probably in Bantford on the 403.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you make the trip again, we can meet for coffee.</div>

<div class="content">Hi again all and thanks for the welcome. The error I received was error 2 then after monkeying with a few things I got an error 11 but after attempting this morning on a fresh boot-up I received the error 2 again. ...On the land &amp; tax thing &amp; being halfbreed I find that it was my ancestors who stole it from my ancestors just the Indian side was here first before the US. ... and yes eriefisher I have been watching and read about your peoples fight and successes...those things are top news in my backyard. You might find a google search for the Lakota Republic interesting too as the Lakota Sioux from Pineridge reservation in S.Dakota severed all treaties ever made with the US in Dec 07 and have since sought assistace thru the UN &amp; received recognition as a sovereign nation and have filed suits against the US for possession of the 5 surrounding states that were originally Lakota territory. They have invited any or all US citizens to renounce US citizenship and become Lakota Republic citizens! Did I mention to anyone things are really heating up in the US?.<br>
Anyway, glad to be among friends. Any ideas on the error2?. Thanks, cowonjolt</div>
