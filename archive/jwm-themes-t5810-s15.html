i noticed that the font-------/font lines look identical to what I've seen in xfontsel<br>
<br>
By launching xfontsel, you can browse the fonts and variants installed on your system.<br>
I'm guessing that JWM wasn't able to render your specified font because<br>
you haven't supplied a valid declaration (matching a currently installed font variation) <br>
- * * * whatever 12 * * * - - -<br>
So, use xfontsel to browse/select a set of parameters (idunno the term."xfont selection"?) appealing to your eye then copy that parameter string into the JWM theme. </div></blockquote>It could also have been that I was editing the wrong file (as per your response in the other thread) as all I was doing was replacing the name of the font specified with another one of my choosing (although perhaps not using the correct name as JWM saw it) and not changing anything else in the file.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>skidoo wrote:</cite>I apologize if my earlier post seemed insulting. No, we are not"dumb". The"behind-the-scenes" stuff, and the configuration required,<br>

often some other"gotcha" will interfere with the custom configuration you're trying to accomplish.<br>

Aaaaaargh! Over in some other directory, within some other file which, at the time, I didn't even know existed...<br>
yeah, some preconfigured"global" setting (applied regardless of chosen theme) was overriding my attempted customization.</div></blockquote>No worries. I was getting frustrated because it seemed it should not be rocket science to change the file, so I was feeling a bit"dumb" at that moment.</div>

However, attempts to change to Verdana or any other sans-serif font ended up looking just like the original with DejaVu Sans.<br>
<br>
I like JWM, but I have already had more success changing up an IceWM theme, so I guess I'll stick with that for now. (I just need to do some reading on changing theme colors and buttons and/or creating themes.) Thanks for your attempts to help me out.</div>

<div class="content">I've been playing with some JWM themes , antiX makes them easy to find and play with.<br>
What I did to try to map out the colors is take an existing theme and rename it , then play with it.<br>
After looking at a few themes , you get how the colors work together , mostly the 2 color gradient stuff.<br>
I found the edge of the active and inactive windows are too skinny to grab with my mouse quickly.<br>
The fonts are pretty basic , you can call out whatever is currently in your system , I like the terminus series myself.<br>
I like to add a"clock" parameter to the theme and adjust its size , it just uses strftime codes for the display.<br>
I like to refer to this site to find the color codes.<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.colorhexa.com/7aa1d1"<br>linktext was:"http://www.colorhexa.com/7aa1d1"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
Just punch in what the theme shows and you have your color to locate in the theme.<br>
I'm no pro , but I've had some quiet time lately to fiddle with my system.<br>
Here's the clock lines to add to the theme as needed.<br>
&lt;ClockStyle&gt;<br>
&lt;Font&gt;Terminus Bold-16&lt;/Font&gt;<br>
&lt;Foreground&gt;black&lt;/Foreground&gt;<br>
&lt;/ClockStyle&gt;<br>
Just add it after &lt;/TrayStyle&gt;<br>
and before &lt;PagerStyle&gt; in the theme.<br>
This gives a black large lettered clock <br>
This shows how to format the clock<br>
&lt;!-- Additional Clock attributes: format, height, width, zone --&gt;<br>
&lt;Clock format="%c"&gt;&lt;/Clock&gt; <br>
This line goes in ~/.jwm/tray<br>
Pretty slick<br>
I didn't find much either on making your own , but it's not too hard if you like to fiddle.<br>

<div class="content">Hey all, <br>
<br>
I know that this is an old thread, but....<br>
<br>
A few days ago, someone pointed out to me that my links on this site for my JWM themes were old and dead. <br>
<br>
I haven't worked on JWM themes in a long while, but I still had all of my old work on my machine. So, I zipped them all up into one zip, and put them back up on my website and media fire. <br>
<br>
There are around 20 themes from Batman to Ryu to Guile, and Winter, Fall, the beach, chocolate, etc... The zip contains the background image I used as well as the .jwmrc files and the screenshots. Some of the folders also have the .conkyrc files too. <br>
<br>
Here are the new links: <br>
<br>
Media fire, direct download of all 20 themes: <br>

 <br>
<br>
My website JWM theme fridays: Has screen shots if you want to know if it is worth downloading the zip file. <br>

 <br>
<br>
Anyways, this is an old thread, but for any lurkers still out there, have at it and enjoy if you can use them! <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, I don't hang out on this forum anymore, so if you have a question or comment for me, you will have to jump over to my website to contact me.</div>
