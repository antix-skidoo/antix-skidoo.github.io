<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br>
as some may know, I've been using AntiX with much happiness recently as an audio production suite. Nice and fast, I really like how it's performing.<br>
<br>
I have a question though about permissions. When I download a VST instrument to test out (usually in windows .dll format), I have to change all the permissions in order to be able to open, play and modify presets freely. It's not a problem, it just takes a bit of time. And, if I happen to not change the right permissions, I risk the instrument not running, crashing LMMS, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Is there an easier way to approach the issue of permissions? (I have a hunch that the majority of my"problems" with AntiX are nothing other than changing the permissions. In my case, not a"risk," since I'm the only one using this particular pc.)<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

I don't know much about what you are doing, but I do know some about permissions.<br>
<br>
Where on your system are you storing these files? what permissions do they start off with, and what permissions do you need?</div>

Hi dolphin_oracle,<br>
<br>
I save the dll file to a folder in my home directory. Depending upon how the instrument is made, it may be just the single file, or it may depend on other files, usually found in a subfolder. It's not always the same. <br>
If they start with just read permissions, I have to change them to read+write as well if I want to be able to use them, since the application itself allows to change the parameters and save the settings as a"preset" file.<br>
<br>
Maybe just a quick run-down on permissions would help me a bit. When I unzip a folder with the files in it, I change the folder to have read+write+execute permissions; but the sub-files will not take the same permissions even if I select"recursive." So I have to change all the files in each folder-- a bit cumbersome...<br>
<br>
And, since I'm not exactly sure which types of files need which permissions, I tend to do them all as r+w+x. Maybe I should change ownerships of the entire directory where I download all the instruments.. ? Perhaps doing it at the CLI will change each and every file and folder.?<br>

users usually have full access to files they own, with the possible exception of the executable bit. maybe try changing the ownership of the files.<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo chown -R $USER:$USER [i]path_to_top_level_folder_you_want_to_change[/i]</code></pre></div>
you may need to change the $USER keys to your own username, but I think with sudo those values should work as is.<br>
<br>
the -R switch should do the recursive stuff.<br>
<br>
there is also a nice gui in the right click menu of spacefm, in the"root" subfolder, for doing quick permission and ownership changes.<br>
<br>
basically you get three permissions levels, <br>
<br>
user<br>
group<br>
everyone<br>
<br>
and each of those can have individual (r)ead,(w)rite, and e(X)ecute privileges. so often you get permissions like this in the home folder:<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code> -rw-r--r--</code></pre></div>
The first bit (-) is a placeholder to tell the system what the file is (remeber, everything in linux is a file). so a link will have a lowercase L, and a directory will have a 'd' and so forth.<br>
<br>
the first three after the id bit is the owner users' permissions. So rw- indicates the user can read and write the file, but not run as an executable (which is the third bit). rwx would indicate the user can read, write, and execute.<br>
<br>
the next three positions are the permissions for owner groups' permissions. the last three are the everyone permissions. <br>
<br>
a blunderbuss approach when all else fails is to set the"everyone" permissions to rwx. <br>
<br>
It may also be possible that your music software has its own user or group, and that setting the group to have the read/write permissions will be enough as well. I'm not well versed in music software.</div>

<div class="content">Be sure your umask setting is correct. Look in .profile the user directory. This doesn't work all the time.<br>

<div class="content">Hi guys, and thanks for the help.<br>
Working with VST instruments in linux is a bit complex I guess, as it's all about programs that utilize the Wine layer for running on linux. <br>
According to this 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#audio_group"<br>linktext was:"configuration page"<br>====================================<br>
, it's important for the user to be part of the"audio" group, and of course I check that I am a part of it. So, when I download a file, I usually have to add"write" to the user group.<br>
<br>
My confustion comes from the fact that these downloaded files need to be run, access other libraries/files included with it, and modify/ save these other files. So it's not always clear if making these modifications and saving them is writing or executing.<br>
Installing these programs never requires root permissions, so I suppose I could avoid the write/execute permissions for root, right?<br>
As for other groups, would that mean other users? Since I'm the only user of the computer, then groups would be irrelevant, right?<br>
<br>
Also, sometimes I notice that a downloaded file will not indicate me as the owner. Could this cause problems? Should I *always* make myself the owner of *all* files?<br>
<br>
@dolphin_oracle: you said that some programs may have their own group. This might be true, and if I have had any problems running any of these, it might be precisely because the group was not in the permissions. I'll check this part in the future! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Probably, the best route would be to allow everyone to r+w+x, as you said.<br>
<br>
@hobbyist7890: thank you for pointing out the umask issue. I've mostly been focusing on the chmod but I'll take a look at umask too! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
