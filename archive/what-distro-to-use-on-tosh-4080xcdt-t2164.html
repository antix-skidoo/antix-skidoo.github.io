<div class="content">Hi there, my name is David.<br>
<br>
I have an old Toshiba Satellite 40XCDT, that I used regularly over 10 years ago and was 'state of the art' back then and had a list price of GBP2,000. It is PII366 and [/i] It is currently running 'Windows 98SE'. It just seems too slow to boot up, and slows down to a crawl, if opening multiple tabs. Additional RAM would no doubt help as it has 64MB RAM built in, and 64MB module installed, giving 128MB RAM total. <em>(I am considering buying a 128MB module, US$10, to replace the 64MB, then would have 192MB total).<br>
<br>
Whilst I used to be familiar with Unix on Sun Sparc workstations, for some Management Systems, and had a go with installing RedHat Linux over 10 years ago, not had any hands on since then. <br>
<br>
I was initially considering 'XP Lite' if I had 192MB RAM installed, but feel I might get faster boot time and better performance from a Linux Distro. One that is suited to older laptops with just PII366 and 128MB RAM and 6GB HDD.<br>
<br>
From the searches I have done, seems that having 128MB RAM rules out the full Linux Distros, but I came across Puppy Linux that looks good. Having download the latest Pup431.iso and created a Live CDRom. I was having trouble getting it to work, but creating a Swapfile sorted that out. <br>
<br>
My initial review is that Puppy Linux is a very comprehensive package with lot of features included, and extremely easy to install and use.<br>
<br>
However I came across a search for Linux on old laptops, and 'Antix' was suggested as being suitable for PII366 with 128MB RAM and small OS size.<br>
<br>
Can someone please confirm if their is a particular version of 'Antix' I could download and set up as 'Live CD' to evaluate how it compares to Puppy Linux?<br>
<br>
Happy New Year 2010,<br>
<br>
Cheers, <br>
David.</em></div>

<br>
your processor and ram specs match mine. So that shouldn't be a problem.<br>
Can't speak for rest of toshiba hardware though.<br>
<br>
Edit: I made a 712 mb swap partition also (while running live) before install using Gparted so as to make the graphical installer not strain during install also.<br>
<br>
I had to add <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>acpi=force</code></pre></div> before booting live cd and also after install I had to add it to kernel line in /boot/grub/menu.lst also so as to get that old lappy and bios to shut down all the way also.Happy New years to you to and Good luck with it. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
