<div class="content">Greetings antiX Forum.<br>
<br>
I am just now bringing to life an old 433 MHz Celeron PC with 512 MB of RAM and two 10GB hard drives. Decided to blow away Windows XP and reformat, installing a small UNIX-inspired OS. That led me to antiX as the first choice. Seeking out an interest community for antiX led me here to the antiX-forum.<br>
<br>
Well, the old PC is up and running, and I am communicating with you using it even now. I loaded <strong>antiX MX-14.3</strong> from an Install/Live CD I got from the nice folks at OSDisc.com in Denver this week. I then downloaded vi/vim, as Leafpad was the only editor I could find on the machine after booting up.<br>
<br>
There are a few little surprises I will try to sort out now that I am in the company of you experts. I will search about first, and then start a thread, or several, if I cannot learn from what is already here.<br>
<br>
The first"surprise" to solve has to do with a networked printer. It is a Samsung Xpress M2835DW, a fairly new laser printer. The antiX"Printer Settings Tool" (if I may all it that) can see it on the LAN, but it cannot find a driver for it. It recommends a generic driver, but does NOTHING after I indicate that the generic driver is okay. It just hangs up right there and will not proceed in any way. A reboot and re-try made no difference.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm having lots of fun after not having had a UNIX machine since the mid '90s. I'm pleased that so much of what I knew back then is"coming to mind." And it's fun to re-learn some things I had forgotten, and to learn about improvements that have come along since.<br>
<br>
I'm pleased to be here amongst you fellow travelers.<br>
<br>

<div class="content">Howdy and Welcome. You can start a new thread about the printer.<br>
Include a <br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>inxi -F</code></pre></div>
report in code tags. If you can provide a link to make and model of printer with a online review or a Debian Link that discusses your printer. Even better.<br>
<br>
I am just a biker scooter tramp that does not even use a printer much except for receipts and work orders in my motorcycle shop and it is a cheapo"Brother"<br>
printer that my lil sis gave me. So I am no printer expert. But others here are.<br>
<br>
So have fun. Once you settle in. You will find AntiX runs good on all your gear. I run it on Touchscreen netbooks, old laptops, desktop machines taken out of dumpsters, and dual core 4 gig ram desktops. 64bit AntiX and 32 bit AntiX.<br>
<br>
It is like the chopper of distros to me.<br>
<br>
Happy Trails Hank, Rok</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roky.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the warm welcome and the much needed guidance for a newbie.<br>

Absolutely. I was wondering whatever command would do that. I read about it in the man entry since you mentioned it. I will certainly include that information with my thread about the printing mystery.<br>

It is very nice of you to help. My newfangled laser printer cost $99 from Amazon... nothing special. <br>

Wow. I'm feeling pretty good about not throwing this old PC out now that it is working well again. Hearty thanks to you and all those folks who made antiX and this forum possible.<br>
<br>
Happy Day.<br>

<div class="content">welcome aboard. I went to the copper country in North Georgia (Blue Lake?) for a vacation once. Great area.<br>
<br>
I can't remember if its here or in the mepis/mx forums at forum.mxlinux.org but there is a user that has samsung printers running. I believe he had to install samsung provided drivers before things would work right. You might use the search tool here and at forum.mxlinux.org for samsung printer and try to find it. <br>
<br>
Maybe he'll see this and chime in <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
**edit*** looks like this site might be a good source for drivers too. One of the mx posters pointed to it.<br>

<div class="content">Welcome to the forums and the distro, hankosaurus. A 433mhz Celeron...man, that IS old.<br>
<br>
Regarding your printer...if there are no Linux drivers on the Samsung support site for the U.S., try the support site for Europe. I'm not sure why, but some manufacturers do not provide Linux drivers for the U.S. market. I wonder if Microsoft is paying them NOT to provide the drivers? Also check 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.linux-drivers.org"<br>linktext was:"http://www.linux-drivers.org"<br>====================================<br>
 to see if your printer is even supported under Linux.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome.and Howdy! Glad you found a way to make your old computer wake-up again.<br>
<br>
Like Krunchtime says, its hard to figure out WHY the manufacturers of some printers don't want to develope Linux drivers for them. Heck whoever would do it for a new inexpensive printer could just about sell 43 MILLION when the Linux community found out. Now that's sales.<br>
<br>
I can take them apart and put them back together again to work, but I know little to nothing about drivers. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
