<div class="content">Hi.<br>
<br>
I've been using Linux distros for a few years now, mainly Linux Mint and Debian, with a smattering of others too.<br>
<br>
I tried Antix on a live disk, courtesy of Linux Format. It worked really well, far better than Mint on my now aging desktop, so I decided to install it. I had no problems with the installation, when fully installed, played around with it. I was really satisfied - it's the quickest distro I've tried.<br>
<br>
I then updated the software, and that's when my problems began, and I need help with them.<br>
<br>
1. I can no longer access the programs - right-clicking on the desktop revealed just a three-line menu, which did not include any programs. The same goes for left-clicking in the bottom left-hand corner;<br>
<br>
2. I cannot access my external hard drive - it is not recognised. The trouble is that's where I stored all my files from the previous system;<br>
<br>
3. I cannot shut down or restart - clicking on Log Off (or is it Log Out?), will only allow me to Log off! The other buttons no longer work.<br>
<br>
Obviously, it sounds as though something went wrong, or was wrong with the update, but it's not helpful!<br>
<br>
I shall stay with the system for now, in the hope that the problems can be put right but, at the moment, I'm having to use my laptop (Linux Mint), which wasn't really the aim of the exercise.<br>
<br>
Please can someone help me dig myself out, and become a happy Antix user?<br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Anti usually handles these but I will try. <br>
<br>
First describe the steps you used when you say you did<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I then updated the software, and that's when my problems began, </div></blockquote>
also what is you sources list that you are using?<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>inxi -r</code></pre></div>
Did you follow/watch 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.youtube.com/user/runwiththedolphin"<br>linktext was:"run with the dolphins video tutorials"<br>====================================<br>

<div class="content">Sounds like an ugly situation. I have done similar things and more than once I'm afraid.<br>
<br>
You are right laptopray, antiX installs quickly. So if I faced your sort of mess I think I would simply reinstall and satisfy myself that the installed system was stable. You then have a choice as to how you ugrade the system. Doing apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade should work. If you prefer smxi also will work.<br>
<br>
I am running antiX-13 full and antiX-13 core. Both of those seem to ugrade without problems so something sent badly wrong with your system. BTW I keep a notebook on all installs so that I can look back and see just what I did. Maybe a good idea?<br>
<br>
If you have the same experience I have had you are gong to learn that antiX is a very quick, very flexible system.</div>

<div class="content">Many thanks, both of you. I followed Julian's advice, but didn't activate as many repos - it worked.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's taught me to be less cavalier when choosing them.<br>
<br>
Thanks again.<br>
<br>
Ray.</div>
