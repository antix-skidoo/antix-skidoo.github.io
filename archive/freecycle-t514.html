<div class="content">This probably only pertains to folks in the US.<br>
<br>
Anyone else out there on the Freecycle lists? For those who don't know what it is, it is an email network (Yahoo) where folks can offer stuff or request stuff -- the only catch is that it has to be FREE. It is pretty much concentrated only to your own particular town, or in my case, county. <br>
<br>
Scored my second free laptop computer today via Freecycle. All I did was ask. <br>
<br>
The first one was an Averatec 3150 with a busted display. Seems the owner busted the screen while deployed in Iraq and had left it with his mother to dispose of. Yielded some good parts (DVD-CDRW, 40 gig hard drive, 512 mb RAM card). I can probably sell the motherboard on eBay for about $100 later. Even the case is worth some eBay money. <br>
<br>
Today an HP Pavilion 485 dropped into my lap. The owner said it booted up then shut down. When I booted up I noticed an install menu for PC-BSD, and sure enough there was an install CD in the DVD-CDRW. My guess is that PC-BSD didn't play well with the AMD Athlon 4 processor, but that is only a guess. Guess the husband must have blown away the Windows 2000 and broke it (for him) during a BSD install. <br>
<br>
So ... PCLOS 2007 has been loaded onto it and I am already an hour into distro update w/out a hint of problems. <br>
<br>
This will be the wife's computer. I bought a Dell D400 on eBay Saturday night. <br>

<br>
Don</div></blockquote>I noticed you like PCLOS. I used to use it with Mepis in the past. I tried PCLOS 2008 also very good systems.<br>
<br>
I want to let you know that you should look into the new 2008 Mandriva system it is similar system like PCLOS but I see great future on it. Being a KDE user I must admit and I predict that Mandriva will be moving real fast to the first liking within the other OS. I was a lot more impress with it than with any PCLOS combination. This is only my own experience with respect to all great OS systems, but I want to let you know because you also use KDE OS and PCLOS. Give it a try if you wish or can than let me know if you wish.<br>
<br>
Best Regards,</div>
