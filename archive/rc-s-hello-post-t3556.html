 type kit. It gets up and goes OK for a 49 year old Truck. I can do 80MPH on the freeway which is the speed limit on the freeways here. It is just a 3 speed with a stock differential rear end. All new bearings, seals, and oil. <br>
<br>
You need a tight motor though to run propane (no bleed off in rings or valve guides. Or Boom, ignition in the rocker box or crankcase if motor is not tight (if you are unlucky). Parts are cheap though and the old iron was made to be rebuilt easily. <br>
<br>
I try to keep my old truck simple. It is just a project I have owned for years. I painted frame and redid everything with black flat paint with silica sand in the paint so the truck has shark skin like finish. I built the bed myself with the bumpers from the front of those little airplane tow cars from a place that went out of business (auction).<br>
<br>
I keep a 2007 Nissan 4.0 litre v-6 , 4 door Pick up truck that I am still paying for also. Payments and Insurance are stress burdens every month. Be glad when I pay it off. <br>
<br>
I picked up 20 new bumpers to build the flatbed frame for $6.00 U.S. Propane tank came from a buddy of mine for free (Rest in peace Brian).

<div class="content">hello rust collector and welcome to antix.<br>
<br>
i envy you roky, i still didn't found a motorcycle that fits me. maybe in the future i'll build my own bike. for now i'm still on four whells with my 10 years old car, it started to show it's age in spite the fact that i change everything that does wrong. the fuel consumption is big i guess the injectors are broken, i have no brakes with new brake disks front and back, the brake pump started to leak bad, the front shocks are gone because of all the speed bumps mounted in strange places and huge holes in the road. ehh but i least i have it all fresh painted and rust free. i'm thinking of selling it and getting a car from england then register it to another country. because in romania they want to introduce a tax for buying second cars already registered in the country, it's like the value of the car, 2000 euros. (illegal) also if we buy cars we have to pay a pollution tax pretty big on a bmw from 2004 (from 1500 euros, illegal again) on top of that everything that goes over 2000cmc has a huge tax from 400 euros and if it's 3000cmc the tax is from 1500 euros. you have to love my country, btw the best salary here is about 600 euros. did i mention that last night we signed ACTA a different version of SOPA?</div>

<div class="content">I am too scared to ride a bike... but the"homebuilt" ones are very cool machines, and I have a lot of respect for anyone that can make a good/nice bike.<br>
I have thought about a smaller bike, like an old 125, or 200-ish cc, just to go to work and such, but the drivers license is quite expensive over here.<br>
I can drive anything at any size and weight, but I can't run a bike bigger than 50cc...<br>
<br>
I have no idea, but is it legal to have a car registered in a different country??<br>
If it is,Go for it!<br>
I guess england would be a good place to buy a new-ish car, as they seem to be cheap for their age there.<br>
<br>
I have to say, I think Romania is an odd country, a bit old fashoned, and a bit modern... But I should just shut up, as I have never been there.<br>
I should take a drive there some time, it is not really that far away.</div>

<div class="content">one method is to have someone with residency in a foreign country and register the car to their name. and the oher method used by lots of romanians is to register the car in bulgaria on certain bussiness that do this things with some loopholes in the laws, as we are eu citizens we have the right to free passing, commerce, buying houses or make insurance on any country in the ue. the romanian authorities try to stop this, as other like italia or spain, because this takes money from their budget. the law that they are trying to pass or herrassment that some people endure on this is illegal and you have to know how they are breaking the law. also yes cars from england are cheaper because they will pass a law that will prohibit people of registering cars older than some years and the other reason that applies to me is that cars that are original with the steering wheel on the left side and adapted to the right are much cheaper than the ones that are not adapted.</div>
