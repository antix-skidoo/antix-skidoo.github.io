 a US judge said it was fine for the New York Police Department to spy on Muslims based solely on their religious preference with no probable cause:<blockquote class="uncited"><div>... Plaintiffs in this case have not alleged facts from which it can be plausibly inferred that they were targeted solely because of their religion. The more likely explanation for the surveillance was a desire to locate budding terrorist conspiracies. The most obvious reason for so concluding is that surveillance of the Muslim community began just after the attacks of September 11, 2001.

<div class="content">People better read up more. Islam is not a religion. It is a copy of Judah-Christian beliefs to mask a totalitarian mindset of total male dominance and hatred. It is a rule by violence. Even the Koran says that"Allah" is the great deceiver. Even the Koran says that Peace will only come with the death of all non-believers. It is a Political mindset of racism,violence, and hatred. Pedophilia is considered normal.</div>

<div class="content">jdmeaux1952 - all you just posted was - in a word - bollox!<br>
and racist bollox at that. <br>
<br>
All religions have their 'terrorist fanatics' to justify domination over others whether the others be women, gays, other religions etc. Also, there is no such thing as a unified Islam in exactly the same way as there is no unifying thought of Christianity. Pedophilia is not considered normal in Islam in the same way as it is not considered normal in Christianity. I'm sure that the overwhelming majority of practicing Muslims are disgusted with pedophilia, as you and I are.<br>
<br>
I'm an atheist. I detest all religions, but I bellieve everyone has the right to follow whatever religious beliefs they hold without the state intervening.</div>

Just substitute anything for religion and you pretty much have covered Southern and parts of Western USA and The Midwest.<br>

<div class="content">Next thing will be"[some dimwit] says it is okay to spy on folks". <br>
Religion, sex, political stance, everything; it doesn't matter what it's based on: it is okay to do it....<br>
<br>
Hell no, it's not okay at all <br>
Not even for [forum dimwits] that have no clue about what constitutes Islam (or probably any other religion).<br>
<br>
I'm not religious; I'm an atheist. But I respect religious motives/beliefs in people, but I detest organized religions, since they manipulate people.</div>

The problem is that if the religious that you are being so tolerant towards were to get their way,"unbelievers" wouldn't be tolerated. They would show no tolerance at all, as history has long shown. You only need to actually read a Bible to discover some of the recorded atrocities, and here are a few to begin with:<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible3.htm"<br>linktext was:"http://nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible3.htm"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked." (Psalms 58:10)</div></blockquote>
Why should any sane person trust any"follower of The Book" and back to the subject of the thread, why wouldn't the state keep a very watchful eye on such people?<br>
<br>
As an anarchist I don't trust the state very much but I trust the people who follow this <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">disgusting</span></strong> book even less.<br>
<br>
And while we're being tolerant, let's have a look at the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">true nature</span></strong> of their deity:<br>

<br>
<br>
I repeat, although I know I'm not going to get an answer, why shouldn't the state be watching such people? For once the state is protecting"The People".</div>

Ignorance even lies in the Linux community . I'm sorry, (not really <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> ), but if one of my gay friends was standing next to me when the below is said. I am not even going to bother to post the link. Like ignorance and hate are not online. <br>

I'd hurt their feelings also. I don't argue with fence posts. I jerk them out. <br>

Religion in my view i<span style="text-decoration: underline">s part of the problem</span> in the world. Above quote is spoken by probably someone who can vote. <strong> Dangerous</strong>.<br>

<div class="content">I don't believe in any organized religion, but I'm not an atheist ether. <br>
Probably because of my grandmothers teaching at an early age in my life.<br>
She was, a native American. Her believe was everyone has a following spirit that guides us.<br>
It could be good, or evil.<br>
The after life is your spirit guiding the next generations, here on earth. <br>

But regardless what organized religion you belong to, you have both good, and evil. <br>
