<div class="content">Recieved a new Magazine that came with a rescue cd in it. On the rescue cd were 4 linux live tools, in which I have found some apps that I think would be interesting to have working with antiX.<br>
<br>
1. mount-gtk --&gt; a little app with a gtk interface that detects all drives on a computer, cdroms', hdds', usbs', ... The detected drives are put in a list with a mount or unmount button beside the device. Simply press mount to mount the device, or unmount to unmount the device, couldn't be more simple.<br>
<br>
2. partition image --&gt; this app allows for the building of an iso image from an installed system on a single partion. Run the program and point it to the appropriate partion and it will build a iso of that partition. I would assume this onl works if you are not building the partition you are running. <br>
<br>
3. ( parted magic ) pmagic_net scripts --&gt; this would be a great set of scripts for antix, it allows for the setting of static /dynamic addressing, managing wireless / wired connections, setting up dialup and pppoe connections, and disconecting / releasing of network information. These scripts would require modification to be applicable to antiX but I think it is worth the try.<br>
<br>
4. gsmartcontrol --&gt; simply tests a hdd's condition and capabilities.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Dave, just saying... a guy posted in the Debian users forum that he ran one of these 'tests' from PartedMagic and it locked his HD and it was a pain to revert the thing.<br>
I myself have PartedMagic in a thumbdrive and last time I needed to run GParted I decided to use the one from PM because it was the latest one. It went wrong and forunately I could use GParted fom Puppy to revert the mess. I had used that mounting tool you mentioned, before using GParted in PM so I'm not sure if it was the mounting tool that made GParted fail. Yes it looks neat but after what happened I decided to not recommend it since I wasn't sure if it wasn't it that messed things for me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi secipolla,<br>
<br>
I did not know that there had been problems with these apps, I ran them on the parted magic cd they seemed to work fine for me. Ran them and nothing happened to my drive, they worked fine so I thought I would post them, glad I did not have these problems would have killed my antiX and all my docs.</div>

<div class="content">Yep, I was resizing my /home partition and it left the operation unfinished... fortunately it was completed by using GParted from Puppy. I suspected it could have to do with me running it from the flashdrive but I think PM runs from RAM.<br>
Could have been just bad luck (PartedMagic, BTW, is a nice live system, with Chromium browser, good persistent options etc.).</div>
