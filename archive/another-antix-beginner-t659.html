<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I had this PIII 450 Mhz 192MB memory with XP on it. You guess, it was very low in starting up. Now years ago I played around with Linux distro's like SUSE and even started with LSF. But all these Linux commands and places to store things made me decide to go back to Windows because I thought there was nothing extra's in Linux for me. But now I want this PIII as machine running on Linux, maybe later as a server. But for now just for internetting, simple office things and the like. Last days I tried Ubuntu (to heavy also), Feather (did not start up my internet automatically) , DeLi (don't know anymore what was wrong with that), PCLinuxOS (I think to heavy also), SliTaz (very fast but basic, will keep this one) and Puppy (not to bad) and then ran into AntiX. Started the liveCD today and I liked it from the beginning. I will have to find my way around I'm sure. First of all I will uninstall Ubuntu. It is on a seperate drive but no need to keep it for now. As I understand AntiX makes no Grub entry. So I will do have to delete all on hda1, install SliTaz and then install AntiX besides it. Well, I hope it will work. If not I hope you will answer my questions on this forum.<br>

<div class="content">Welcome to Antix!<br>
<br>
It looks like you have been through the gambit of Linux distros. They are all solid distros in there own right. Antix offers a good balance of everything with great hardware recognition and ease of set up.<br>
<br>
As far as grub is concerned, it will be installed when you install Antix. Are you planning to dual boot or will it stand alone? What you need to do will be determined by your set up. Let us know what you want to do and we can help.<br>
