<div class="content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
So, I haven't been on the forum in a while... I feel a bit lousy showing my face only when I have troubles. Yet, I need help.<br>
<br>
So, my compu running Antix 7 has had no trouble getting wireless to work with Cisco 350 PCMCIA for the past evereal months. I keep my compu at home connected to our apartment's wireless, never really go to another network. But, last week, I did move it. I took my laptop to school, and I tried to get on the wireless there. So, I went to mnetwork and changed the SSID and the code to the school's. It didn't work immediately, and I gave up... Anyway, I came home and reset the parameters to my apartment's, and it is not working here. I changed the SSID back to ours, and I changed the WEP code to ours, so that is all correct. I rebooted, etc... Then, I started digging. iwconfig shows eth0 as having no wireless connection, and eth1 and wifi0 as my device correctly. Why are both interfaces showing this card? Is this correct? iwlist shows no wireless networks. Though, my roommates have no problem (in fact, I am on the network now using Brian's portal). Also, in mnetwork, when I instruct the machine to connect eth1 at"apply", the script says"<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>wifi0: unknown hardware address type 801

wifi0: unknown hardware address type 801
Listening on LPF/eth1/00:.......
Sending on  LPF/eth1/00........
Sending on Socket/fallback
DHCPRELEASE on eth1 to 192XXXXXXXX port 67
send_packet: Network is unreachable
send_packet: please consult README file.....

etc... etc....
This is all abreviated, and I am tired of transcribing from one screen to another....   God, I should have read script earlier.  It suggests looking athte README, and here I am bugging you all.  I didn't actually read it, but it may have some useful info.  I'll chack it out.  Anyway, some thing got messed up when I changed the wireless settings.  Any ideas?   I am sure that teh SSID and the WEP are correct.   

Man, BTW... The chat section is coving the whole page on this computer.  So, I can't read so easily.  I cant wait to get back on my antix!  I love it.  

See you all later.  Thank you for the help in advance!  

Nick</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="content">I would try to get wicd or ceni installed. It should allow more mobility. Wicd also allows for multiple network profiles.<br>
<br>
As for Mnetwork, I would clear every screen one by one and click apply each time, reboot and then re-enter the info one screen at a time clicking apply each time again. Also have a look at /etc/network/interfaces, it might reveal some info.</div>

<div class="content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
I have made some progress in getting my wireless working, yet I have not been totally successful. Here is where I am at...<br>
<br>
My wireless interfaces are eth1 and wifi0. In mnetwork, I have both of these configured with my house's SSID and WEP code. All other interfaces are not activated. Now, first, I tried to use DHCP to recieve an IP address, but I kept having trouble with this. Repeatedly, I would get an error saying that dhcp packets were not being retrieved. So, I suspected that maybe my router did not have dhcp on it? I changed my setting for both of these interfaces to have generic static IPs and typical subnet, broadcst, etc. addresses. Then, upon activation of these interfaces, I had some success. Mnetwork now indicates that the two are activated, but I still haven't any internet connection. I looked at my roommate's mac (which I am using now), and his network configuration says that his IP was assigned via dhcp. So, of course, dhcp must in fact be on our router... So, the real problem must be somewhere else. I do not know what to do at this point. What should I be looking for now? <br>
<br>
I know that the card works, for"iwlist scan" shows our SSID on these interfaces, so it is sending and recieving. What could be the problem? What other ends of the configuration should I be looking at? Any help would be much appreciated. <br>
<br>
Okay, I hope you all are having wonderful weekends! Thanks for the help!<br>
<br>

<br>
I have tried every avenue that I can imagine to fix this problem, But I am having no luck. My last sttempt to resolve this should work. I am backing up and reloadiong the whole thing. In fact, this will give me a chance to go from antiX 7 to the newest release! Quick and dirty...</div>

<div class="content">Is your device actually recognized? The output you provided earlier suggests otherwise. That could present a problem as far as running the device natively if that is actually the case. However, antiX and the majority of recent distributions offer something called ndiswrapper, which is capable of accessing Windows wireless device driver information in .inf files and activating a driver.<br>
<br>
Best practice is to always attempt to access a wireless device through native means first, but then use ndiswrapper with Windows drivers from the manufacturer if the device is not otherwise activated and supported.<br>
<br>
Are you familiar with these practices? If not, we can help you through looking into this further.</div>

<div class="content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
a few days have passed... Economy is crashing... Exgirlfriend is back in town... My wireless is still not operational. I am at a loss.<br>
<br>
Here is where I am at. With Cisco Aironet 350 plugged into PCMCIA, I boot up. The system recognizes the adapter, loads driver. Yet, when networking starts, DHCP doesn't work, no packets are received. Checking /proc/driver/aironet/eth1/, files are present, seemingly all in place. Rechecking SSID, WEP, and DHCP in mnetwork, all are configured correctly. 'iwlist scan' recognizes my SSID, connection looks great. Yet, no DHCP packets received! <br>
<br>
Oh, also at startup is this:<br>
* Not starting ipw3945 regulatory daemon, driver not loaded.<br>
<br>
Oh, maybe this is the problem! So, I checked in Synaptic, and ipw3945 is loaded! It is part of antix package! So, why is it not recognized at boot? Does this matter? What is going on? I have looked though so many forums, and I am learning quite a lot about Linux wifi configuration, but I cannot get this problem solved. Weird thing is, this card did work not too long ago on this system...<br>
<br>
As far as ndiswrapper issue... I think that the aironet module I have is native. I mean, I think it is the same as the module distributed by Cisco, and they are actively developing Linux modules. So, I am not sure if there is an issue here too...<br>
<br>
Okay all, I'll keep trying. Please throw out any ideas you have! Anything- really! Any ideas at all! I'll appreciate any an all. Thank you all for your help! I appreciate every lovely bit of advice I get from this awesome community. As a Linux enthusiast, yet confusedest, I am making progress due to your wonderful company. <br>
<br>
Later, <br>
Nick</div>

<div class="content">Sitting here at a distance, it's really hard to figure out what's happening. Usually when I run into a particular problem, I either see a diagnostic in front of me, or I run one, and that sometimes helps. For a first level of information, try typing inxi -F at a console. That provides full information about the overall system.<br>
<br>
See if the command ceni works at all for you, and if you can configure or reconfigure the interface that you want to use. Send us any output from either of these commands that you can capture; that may give us some further clues.</div>
