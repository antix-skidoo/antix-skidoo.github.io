<div class="content">Antix, and Linux in general, your internal drives, or partitions, are named differently from the way windows names them. They will not be C or D or E or whatever. Linux is going to call your partitions something like sda1 or hda1 or sda2 or whatever, depending on how many parititions you have. The partitions are typically accessed from the /mnt folder. you can access this folder from the filemanager. I have a screen shot attached here from the filemanager that is started from the icewm toolbar (blue folder). Clicking on the"File System" link will move you to the top of the file folder tree, called root or / . Navigation is just like navigating with a windows file explorer. / would be generally equivalent to the C: on a windows machine. So to get to your internal drives, you can start the file manager, navigate up the tree to root and then down the tree to /mnt.</div>

<div class="content">Thank u guy's three 4 ur kind help, instruction, comment and (kind) rebuke(s): I consider myself atdvised and corrected - but perhaps only a little encouraged, though ur comments are, in general, respected and appreciated.<br>
In the words of - 'whomever' -"I hear what u say!" - but I have further comment, viz. while, 'this is the way it is done' - and always will be done - what happened 2 the idea that"u can always build a better mousetrap" and"a picture is worth (really) a thousand words" ? We already went though the UNIX and DOS thing quite some time ago - are we not 2 progress?<br>
Dolph, thanx 4 your effort with the Screenshot - understood. Q1: did u miss out the stage where I have 2 mount the sda1? - as it was, it gave me back a volume of 1024 (I think) Mb (and nothing else, no files) - whereas I saw it b4 (somewhere in Antix) showing the correct size. Q2: I looked in the ROX(?) help 2 try and find out the meaning of the 'tick' and 'cross' shown on the file icons - no such simple luck! - Q3: what do they mean please? Q4: do all the latest (small) distros eschew a GUI?<br>
Kind regards, Grani</div>

<div class="content">well, maybe.<br>
<br>
1. rox-filer (a file managers included with antix) will automatically mount a drive when you select it. With thunar (the other filemanger included in antix) you do have to mount the partition first. when you have an installed system, you can modify your /etc/fstab file to automount the internal partitions. The reason the directory showed up so small with no files is because it wasn't mounted. In Linux, everything is represented in the file system (or directory structure) as a file. you accessed a pointer file that once the parition is mounted will point to the partition. I agree that this is the most annoying thing for a windows user to get used to is the non-automounting of partitions. I'm of the opinion that internal drives should always be automounted by default, but that is not currently the case.<br>
2 and 3. the"tick" is probably the symbol for a symbolic link, or a pointer file. this shows up a lot on the live cd due to the way the compressed file system is used. the cross is the symbol for a file or directory/folder that you do not have access to as a regular user. You would need to be using the root, or administrator account, to access those folders. These are typically files or folders you wouldn't access in your day to day usage, but possibly would while setting your machine up or while changing some settings.<br>
4. We have a gui, its just different from a desktop environment which is what you are used to on windows. We use a window manager, which actually is a basic but seperate component of desktop environments (like xfce or gnome or kde to name the famous ones). The windows managers (icewm and fluxbox in our case) are much less resource intensive than the big DE's, which is why the distros aiming at slower and/or older machines tend to rely on them. KDE in particular is almost unusable on my netbook, but fluxbox is very very fast. The trade off is configuration... you tend to have to edit configuration files manually rather than using gui tools. Its slightly more complicated, but realistically you don't access those files very often in the course of using the computer. The wm's will display your installed software, and the individual software's gui's will be intact. <br>
