<div class="content">At the moment, users can upgrade installed apps from antiX-M7 to antiX-M7.5-test, but you won't get the antiX changes ie changes in wallpaper, fluxbox and icewm configuration, controlcentre, scripts etc.<br>
<br>
I'm looking at a way to automate this process, but don't know the best way to go about it. Here is what I would like to happen.<br>
<br>
Either via the smxi script, or another one, download a tarball or .deb with all the new changes and extract all of it to the correct places so the user does nothing, or very little.<br>
<br>
This still will not make an upgraded M7.2 (even less antiX-M7) exactly the same as antiX-M7.5 as some apps have changed.<br>
<br>
Any ideas, helpers welcome.</div>

<div class="content">True, but the idea is so that people wouldn't have to install the newest version, but simply apt-get the newer antiX stuff.<br>

I noticed that. MEPIS has been a great platform, but I was wondering if you were hedging your bets so that antiX would continue to have a solid base platform, or do you just like to have something slightly"hot and spicy"? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

Say, h2! So far smxi is working REAL well with AntiX. I am going to go a bit further with SimplyMEPIS. I am going to switch it from Etch to Sid. I already switched it to Lenny, but the Iceape browser and the Iceweasel browser both became VERY unstable - I assume that is due to plugins, Flash, Java, or something along those lines. I have seen none of that behavior before in ages, so I am suspecting Lenny has some dirt in it. I am going all the way to Sid with that old MEPIS install and see how smxi does. I suspect it will do much better with tools that work,<br>
<br>
Will let you know later. As far as interaction on the AntiX stuff, it has been flawless as far as I can tell, have not run into a single issue.</div>

<div class="content">re iceweasel etc, I lost my iceweasel on my oldest install, and can now only run swiftfox on it. I cannot figure out why that install failed, it's always been sid, from kanotix to sidux. It has nothing to do with profiles or plugins, I tested all possible things, and it's something else in the system, of older systems, but I don't know what.<br>
<br>
the iceweasel 3 upgrade was a huge one, and it requires a bit of preparation.<br>
<br>
Best is to remove / purge all iceweasel, seamonkey stuff prior to the upgrade I think. I believe it may be a lib xul runner issue, but i"m not sure.</div>

For what it's worth, Iceweasel and Iceape both work for me on sidux and antiX, plus now that I took my SimplyMEPIS to Sid - and spent the better part of the night working on it, Iceape and Iceweasel seem to be behaving once again.<br>
<br>
But you are right, if they act up, torch 'em, get rid of configurations and start over. If I see any repeated instability again, that is what I will do. Right now I only saw it on one distro and I only saw it when I went from Stable to Testing, went away when I went to Sid. That was on my SimplyMEPIS setup. Seems to be fine now.<br>
<br>
BTW, antiX and sid work together nicely with smxi. I have it looking like a sidux system with a antiX appearance. Still have all the lightweight antiX stuff, so it makes for a nice system. I call it my antiX-sidux hybrid! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

You ought to try iceape sometime, h2, unless you are absolutely set on some Firefox - iceweasel plugins. Some plugins work with iceape - a.k.a. Seamonkey. You may know that Seamonkey is the carry on of the original Mozilla suite. What you may not know is that many of the performance improvements in the core engine are worked out first in Seamonkey. I find it to be, in general, more stable and more conservative with memory usage, even though it is a suite, than the stand alone Firefox code. My guess is that part of it is quality control and that part of it is that the XUL stuff used by Firefox and Thunderbird consumes additional memory resources. Whatever the reason, I really like the original suite, now called iceape in the Debian DFSG world! Give it a try some time!</div>
