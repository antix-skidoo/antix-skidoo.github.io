<div class="content">dave, i didn't say it as a criticism or to imply something, only as an observation. <br>
i said it from the start that this will be time consuming, retarded and a choresome.<br>
i have also noticed that the tooltip when i hover the mouse over the subsection<br>
name is larger that it should be, but this is something that is not noticed ofter.<br>

Thanks Skidoo,<br>
I have webinspector figured and css (it is not the first time working with either). However within the css definitions / html construction of the forum base things are overlapping / recycled / duplicated / not used. BTW anything AFAIK that has red as a color (#FF0000) I have inserted in at some point to see what all changes, so I will need to remove that. <br>
<br>
What I meant (as I have not written the forum software) is for example:<br>
If you change the"bread crumbs" drop down styling it also changes the drop downs in the tool tips and forum options sections (which is likely why the tool tip is funny sized).<br>
If an option is enabled that you need to override to disable for one part it will also cause issues with another block as your block declaration will overlap with another block (and you cannot differentiate as you cannot edit the main code (html/php)) (which is likely why the avatar labeling is bad when highlighted from modifying the breadcrumb links so you can see them against the black).<br>
The avatar image is a background image in a container not an actual &lt;img&gt; tag... changing the container values also changes container values the header...<br>
ETC<br>
<br>
I am not taking it as anything against me. Just adding stuff to the"stone soup" as I work my way down from top to bottom of the page and adding to the forum when the positive changes outweigh the negative. For example did anyone try using the breadcrumbs dropdown before last night with the #FFFFFF background and the #FEFEFE text color? That way anyone else can continue improving otherwise everyone would be doing it alone by trying to fix everything locally... no?  dark-D is correct, it is a bear to update and very time consuming... I think tapatalk is still phpbb in the background and therefor is a theme in itself which is likely why there is no implementation for setting themes.<br>
<br>
BTW for the avatar section there are actually 3... 2 are hidden by default with one visible. </div>

<div class="content">i have noticed that the different menus with pictograms, topic tools, display and sorting options, quick mods tools, jump to, search, advanced search disappear if i hover on them. maybe we should remove the code that was added today until we sort it out. it feels like the more we add the more it breaks. it's a bummer this method of adding on top of the theme, i have also noticed the code that is not used and left behind when i was looking around in the inspector. also in the inspector, i can't figure out what causes the post count bubble to change size on hover, or what in the header causes the page to add an extra section on the right of unused space. i'm still trying to get the help of someone who does this for a living, but so far everyone is"busy".</div>

v------------ would need to investigate further to confirm, but it looks like tapatalk has"wrecked" (performed bulk modification of post_body content within the db) pre-existing internal hyperlinks.<br>
example: 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was"a-trashcan-for-the-antix-desktop-t6689.html#p49032"<br>linktext was:"a-trashcan-for-the-antix-desktop-t6689.html#p49032"<br>====================================<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>skidoo wrote:</cite>

<br>

post42803.html#p42803
</div></blockquote>
What you see here in the quotebox is verbatim/identical to what you'll find if you click through to that topic page as it exists now.<br>
At time of posting (and up until tapatalk"makeover") those were hyperlinks leading to previous posts within pre-existing topics.<br>
<br>
<br>
I found nothing here discussing (ideas for, or scraping success) tapatalk<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.reddit.com/r/phpBB/search?q=tapatalk&amp;restrict_sr=on"<br>linktext was:"[https://www.reddit.com/r/phpBB/search?q ... rict_sr=on"<br>====================================<br>

and<br>

hello skidoo  That is a lot of different names to call a site.  One thing that changed on that site t7115= there was a link in the attachment comments . It provided another live link to the little image download. That link disappeared. <br>

<div class="content">Just a heads up. I belonged to to the old support hosting forum for our forum site. I have been in contact with our old admin there and things have changed so much that my old username, email, password , etc..... is no good anymore.

Just a excerpt from my correspondence with ChrisM. The lady who ran the old support group. <br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Oh I see.<br>
Tutorials is not a support forum (I am going to disable registrations there). I had registrations turned on for people to share tutorials, but I think it’s too confusing and people think it is a support forum.<br>

Any forum you posted at when it was still on the old Yuku platform, your login will work there. Any other forums, you’ll need to register first before you can participate.<br>
That said the support forum I just linked to already has Global ID enabled as a test, but it is one of the only forums that has it enabled at the moment.<br>
This means, when you sign up there, you are signing up for a global tapatalk account (might need to search a bit, because with over 15 million accounts, many usernames are taken).<br>
Once you’ve signed up, follow the activation link in your email, and then you will be able to set your forum username.<br>
