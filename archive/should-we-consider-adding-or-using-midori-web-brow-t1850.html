<div class="content">I noticed not very long ago that Paul Sherman from Absolute Linux was looking into the possibility of using Midori as a REPLACEMENT for Firefox as his DEFAULT Web browser in a recent release candidate of Absolute Linux 13.0. I am not sure that Midori is solid enough in every aspect and feature to give it quite that prominent a spot, but at the same time, I think its development is further along than Dillo, for example, which seems rather dormant. <br>
<br>
Given the fact that we have several browsers, and if someone REALLY needs a super light browser, there is elinks in our collection, and also links2. How about either ADDING midori to our browser collection or REPLACING Dillo with midori? I have been testing it and in fact, I am using it here right now. I've run it for several hours many times without crashes. It isn't 100% perfect. Once in a while, something will not render right, but this is not frequent, and rendering is actually BETTER than Dillo, and handling of cookies is also better than Dillo.<br>
<br>
Whaddaya think? Worth adding to our list of browsers or worth replacing one of our existing browsers? At 1/3 the footprint of Firefox, Paul thought it worthy of at least investigation. This is antiX though, so what say ye?</div>

<div class="content">Midori is a very promising browser. Light and fast and does go with our motto of 'lean and mean'.<br>
However, it does not play apple trailers (not that I watch them, but some 'reviewers' use this as a criterion in their evaluation of a distro) and a download plus dependencies is actully larger than iceweasel. (c25MB if I remember correctly)<br>
Dillo is moving forwards, though at a slow pace, but its main use it (IMO) for opening html files already downloaded or super fast browsing to 'simple' sites. ie no java ads crap. (It can be seen as a feature)<br>

<div class="content">I checked out Midori's webpage. I have not tried it yet, but I noticed that it lists as optional depencies sqlite 3.0.<br>
I already have sqlite since my bibliographic software (bibus) uses it, but I wonder why Midori needs it?<br>
<br>
I'll give it a try and see how it feels.<br>

<div class="content">I haven't done it for a while but I was building midori as the xfce goodies people were announcing new releases. I like the browser just fine but I could not keep up with the dependencies for each new build.<br>

<div class="content">I have been able to use the version of Midori that is in Testing to access this forum and several of the other forum sites that I participate in. Midori lacks the Adblock plug in capabilities you can get in Iceweasel, but it is richer in features and the number of sites that it can accurately render, compared to Dillo. Use cases could be made to justify the use of either one. For me, I am more apt to use Midori now than Dillo. Other thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages of either one?</div>

<div class="content">As you asked for thoughts: I'm using Opera in Ubuntu Hardy now. I opened System Monitor then Dillo (2.0) = 1,5 MB, then Firefox (3.0.12) = 46,4 MB.<br>
<br>
I tried Midori (the latest version) in Ubuntu a while back (maybe a week ago) and promptly uninstalled it since it had some glitches, the most noticeable one was that the keyboard wouldn't work properly in it (maybe all keys besides letters and numbers and space). Also, maybe due to Ubuntu's packaging, a lot of configuring options were grayed out.<br>
<br>
Dillo 2.1 is pretty usable, it even renders properly the site's colours <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
It doesn't comply with non-standard web but as a layman in the subject, I think that after some chaotic growth the web will be more standardized now on. Also it's TLS/SSL support is in alpha stage, I think so one can't access gmail or yahoo mail, for example, but that's what Claws mail is made for.</div>

<div class="content">I guess that I am in the minority so far in terms of enjoying using the Midori Web browser. I will keep my eyes on its ongoing development because I find that it renders the pages in forums like this one very well. It seems that its value at the present time is insufficient to warrant inclusion in the release, but I will continue to monitor it and report on the progress.</div>

<div class="content">But my observations don't actually consider if it's good or not for antiX. First, I don't have an antiX install anymore (but I could try it in live mode with Midori) and then, which I consider quite important, I have 768 MB RAM and a 2,53 GHz CPU (although kind of PIII generation). When it comes to apps in antiX and saving resources, I think every subject should pass through the sieve of &lt;=PIII users and, perhaps, 256 MB RAM or something alike. Like if Midori brings good functionality with a reasonable (from the point of view of those low resource machines) resource saving in respect to Iceweasel.</div>
