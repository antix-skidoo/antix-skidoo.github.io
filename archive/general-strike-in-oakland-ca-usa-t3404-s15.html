<div class="content">anticapitalista, That doesn't sound all that different from the coups that occurred in Turkey in the 70's and 1980. The one in 1980 is the most similar to Egypt. There was political unrest and political violence erupted in the Turkey, the military refused to intervene, they allowed it to escalate, then at a time of their choosing, the military seized power. The people in Turkey didn't idly stand by and do nothing after that. The military in Turkey viewed themselves as the"guardians" of the some constitution, which i believe they rewrote. So that doesn't really make sense. Anywho, the military in Turkey eventually turned over power to the people after a few years. Well, for the most part. That's the basics for what happened in Turkey, there's obviously way more.<br>
<br>
I'm not mentioning Turkey as an attempt to change the subject, but because it's very similar to what is goin on in Egypt. In Egypt there was political unrest and violence, the Egyptian military didn't intervene, and they sat back and chose a good time to seize power. The Egyptian military view themselves"defender of constitutional legitimacy."<br>
<br>
A coup involve a small group of conspirators seizing power, if power that's taken and is held, then it's a coup d’etat. They tend to lead to the formation of a military junta. This is what happened during the Egyptians"revolution."<br>
<br>
We'll have to agree to disagree. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

The Tea Party doesn't get the best press from the US media. Maybe from Fox news they do, but it's Fox and everyone knows Fox is way off to the right, except Fox. Some of the US media put the Tea Party as a right-winged movement and labeled them as a bunch of racists. They come off, at least to me, as a bunch of ignorant Christian zealots and nationalists.</div>

<div class="content">The only Tea Party Members I met was the lady next door that lives by my Mom when I visited her buttcoffee.<br>

She was trying to get my Mom to watch fox news and extolled it's virtues to her."Fair and Balanced" and what not.<br>

She has been through WW2 camps and you can not sway her any when it comes to politics or government philosophy. That is probably why I am what I am. She recognizes a fascist when she hears one. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://robertreich.org/post/13163087845"<br>linktext was:"The First Amendment Turned Upside Down"<br>====================================<br>
 by Robert Reich<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>... the Supreme Court says money is speech and corporations are people.<br>
<br>
... If there’s a single core message to the Occupier movement it’s that the increasing concentration of income and wealth at the top endangers our democracy. With money comes political power. <br>
<br>
... The First Amendment is being stood on its head. Money speaks, and an unlimited amount of it can now be spent bribing and cajoling politicians. Yet peaceful assembly is viewed as a public nuisance and removed by force.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>
Bitjam, Reich is a partisan hack/politician and I assumed the occupy movement wanted to distance themselves from people like Reich. What Reich wrote is not true. But, I'm curious why he forgot to mention that unions are now"people" in that article? So, based on what he wrote in his blog, I'm going to assume he's also against freedom of speech for unions. <br>
<br>
Do you support the censorship of unions by the US government?<br>
<br>
Previously, unions were subjected to the same law that the corporations were. Unions and Corporations were censored by the US government from funding political broadcasts during elections. It seems Reich is all for censorship, which is the first amendment is suppose to protect us from. <br>
<br>
I personally don't believe in any type of censorship and I think it's wrong to censor people or organizations. I think it's even more wrong to censor people or organization for political speech and political beliefs.<br>
<br>
Speaking of the first amendment. Would you be for or against the impeachment of Obama for ordering the assassination of an US citizen who's only"guilty" of exerting influence on others? Basically having a US citizen killed for what amounts to speech"crimes."</div>

The Tea Party people seem way too out there for me. I went to their Glenn Beck rally in DC since I liveclose by. Half of them were convinced Obama isn't a US citizen, but was really born somewhere in Africa and his Hawaiian birth certificate is a forgery. Then there were the ones that believed all that, but took it a step further by claiming Obama is a Muslim. There's nothing a Tea Partier hates more than a Muslim, well maybe a"muslim socialist." Asking them why they believed that seemed like a lost cause, none would admit it's because he's a black guy with a non-western sounding name. <br>
<br>
I left during Sarah Palin's speech and decided the rally should've been called"Destroying any Honor the US still has" in stead of"Restoring Honor." I also went to the john Stewart one<br>
<br>
Fox news are the only ones that haven't figured out they're not"Fair and Balanced." I'm gonna assume your mom is jewish?</div>

Neither my Father or Mother is Jewish. My Father was Catholic. Mom was Russian Orthodox. My Dad comes from Poland, Mom the Ukraine. Both came from large extended families that did not survive the camps of WW2. Slave Labor camps besides Death Camps abounded during WW2 in Eastern Europe. Gypsies, Homosexuals, Mentally handicapped, Physically Handicapped, Slavs, all were interned in one way or the other and killed.<br>
<br>
My Dad had baseball size tumors of broken veins on the back of his shin muscles from wheel burrowing bodies 20 hours a day 7 days a week as a teenager, (I had to get him drunk to tell me that).<br>
<br>
My parents shielded me from the horrors of war growing up. Nothing was ever talked about. But I was ruled with a iron fist growing up and was taught to survive no matter what the environment ,(including to keep ones mouth shut when one perceives danger). As a Kid I did not notice this. Only Later when my Mom gave me the documentation of the camps She and Dad stayed at for my induction into the USMC did I become aware of a lot of what went one before I was born.<br>
<br>
My handle rokytnji is part of that past. I knew my Mom's father and he had a saying.<br>
"Justice is only gotten from 6 feet under". I did not know what he meant by that till later growing up.<br>
<br>
I look at some of what goes on in the states today with certain cliques and areas. I have in laws in Alabama and Mississippi and I live in TX. I see little sparks and fires of fascism in all these areas from time to time. I don't suffer from it because I am considered a"good ol boy" because of my USMC status.<br>
<br>
It does not mean I agree with their outlook on strangers though or customs they don't understand. But. I keep a low profile because my parents taught me fighting/arguing with ignorance can be like"arguing with a barb wire fence post . It can hurt you if you aint careful". <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">I never really hear much about the Russians and others that the Nazis killed. I know the nazis put Russian soldiers in death camps. I didn't really know they did it to civilians, but I'm not surprised. I'm guessing your parents left Europe whenever it was possible. Living one massive war and possibly two would want to make me leave fast.<br>
<br>
I thought you username was a reference to Roky Erickson of the 13th Floor Elevators and because you live in Texas. I guess I was off on that. I'm assuming when you write"Happy Trails" it's a reference to Quicksilver Messenger Service because they have an album with the same name.<br>
<br>
People tend not to mess around with marines and bikers. That's just what I'd think. Texas is probably a more interesting state to live in than Maryland. Maryland is a bunch of stressed out spazzes <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
