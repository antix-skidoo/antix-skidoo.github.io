<div class="content">Hello everyone!<br>
I'm on Debian 7 KDE and I'm looking for a lightweight, stable but fast-to-boot-up Linux distro. I'm trying to understand how AntiX differs from Debian and other distros. These are my hardware specs:

I also have some questions that I'd like you to address:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does it come with flash-plugin and codecs pre-installed (such as Linux Lite)?</li>
<li>How difficult is it to install a working, basic TeXLive distribution? What about EMACS and AUCTeX, how do you install them?</li>
<li>Is it true one needs to install Locale settings from scratch such as keyboard layout? I'd like to configure my system to use Colemak instead of good, ol' QWERTY. (<strong>← This is really important to me!!</strong>)</li>
<li>How does it compare to Crunchbang 11? Can I make AntiX look dark and somber like Crunchbang? How much RAM is it going to cost me?</li>
<li>How does it compare to Linux Lite OS, in term of RAM consumption at login?</li>
<li>How much RAM does a browser and 1 or 2 applications running in the background, take up?</li>
<li>How long does it take to boot?</li>
<li>Does Thunar, the file manager, have"Find"/"search" capabilities?</li></ol>
Thank you in advance to whoever takes the time to answer my doubts.</div>

<div class="content">1. yep, and libdvdcss is available via simple install in our metapackage-installer. Most codecs work OOTB.<br>
2. Don't know, but all the apps you mention are available in the debian repos, which are enabled by default.<br>
3. Locale stuff is installed by default, but you'll need to configure. Language choice is available on the live media via an Fkey menu, and those settings will carry over to install. You might need to mess with the keyboard setting though, not sure. In MX edition, the XFCE Keyboard app will let you add the colemak layout to you standard keyboard.<br>
4. antiX-15 is more up to date than Crunchbang 11, since now based on Jessie. Lots of themes available, including some nice dark ones, for icewm, jwm, and fluxbox. I don't think it will cost you any ram, its just themes, and the light desktop is just another theme. the MX edition of antiX is still debian-wheezy based, so basically the same as #!-11, but with a community repo providing backported packages. I've got no complaints...<br>
5. I haven't tried Linux Lite in a while, but both antiX and MX are likely lighter on ram usage, as Linux Lite uses XFCE for a desktop and pulseaudio for the sound setup. antiX uses a plainer WM setup and goes with straight alsa for audio. I would guess antiX would be at least 60 mb lighter than Linux Lite, but that's a guess. MX edition uses about 150 mb on startup (depending on enabled services) and still uses the XFCE desktop, but not pulseaudio by default.<br>
6. I use around 500 mb with a modern chrome browser and 3 tabs. Otherwise, it depends on the apps. XMMS or moc for music don't take up hardly anything.<br>
7. My core I5 system takes around 20 seconds to boot to antiX-15 64bit. That is on a spinning hard drive, non-SSD. boot time for MX edition is slightly longer, probably around 30 seconds. This will be dependent on your particular hardware. <br>
8. antiX -15 proper does not use thunar/xfce. But, file searching is available via the searchmonkey app and through the spacefm file manager search utility, which I happen to like. If you are talking about antiX MX edition, which does feature the XFCE/Thunar setup, then most of what I've said above still applies, and an app called Catfish is available for file searching. Thunar doesn't support file searching itself, but the MX team did integrate file searching into thunar via right click menu custom actions.<br>
<br>
If you post your hardware specs, we might be able to offer some suggestion about which edition you should install. But if your computer was built in the last 5 years or so, MX edition should really fly on it. There is a dedicated MX community as well at forum.mxlinux.org and a website at mxlinux.org. <br>
<br>
The live media for both antiX-proper and the MX edition are quite good. Give them a try and see if you like it. I run one of my systems exclusively from a liveUSB stick, never installed to the hard drive. Once its booted up, its still quite fast.<br>
<br>
Hope all that helps.</div>

<div class="content">5. Running both. I see no major difference except in ram usage like Dolphin Oracle Mentioned.<br>
Linux Lite idles at twice as much ram as MX-14. Even more difference with Icewm in AntiX 15.<br>
<br>
4. Crunch bang has always seemed emptier of tools OOTB than AntiX to me. Personal Opinion and all.<br>
No locate, smxi, after initial install. (command not found). Kinda strange for a big iso.<br>
<br>
7. Boots fast (10 seconds to slim login) on my SSD atom netbook.<br>
<br>
Hmmmm, should you install AntiX? I don't know. I only know about me.,<br>
Mom always told me."Eat it! How do you know you won't like it if you do not taste it!"<br>
Then whack my head with a wooden spoon.<br>

<br>
All questions on setting up locales and keyboard layouts he has probably already covered in his videos from installing and setting up AntiX on your computer to using AntiX Control Center.<br>
<br>
A lot of your questions can be answered just spending time watching videos on his channel.<br>
<br>
Maybe you can see if I covered the dark and somber look in the below threads also.<br>

<br>
First post contains a raft of questions which could easily be, SHOULD be, self-determined <br>
by spending a few minutes creating a LiveCD or LiveUSB and test driving the distro.<br>
What's the likelihood that anyone reading is familiar with AUCTeX <strong>and</strong> TEXLive <strong>and</strong> Colemak -flavored keyboard ???<blockquote class="uncited"><div>How much RAM does a browser and 1 or 2 applications running in the background, take up?</div></blockquote>Seriously?<br>
The answer to this ridiculously open-ended question must be"Yes, definitely. Except on tuesdays."

So if I install MX instead of AntiX, I get to configure the keyboard else nothing? I'm asking this because in Debian KDE I installed other desktop environments (GNOME, Openbox, LXDE) just to see if they recognized Colemak layout. I first installed Colemak system-wide, through a script using CLI, then configured it via GUI. This went on fine in KDE but the other DE couldn't pick it up and only work with QWERTY.<br>

Keyboard, as you may all know, is essential in learning EMACS, so if I don't have the right keys under my finger tips, I loose in efficiency and effectiveness. Compiling long, structured LaTeX projects, with charts and figures can be quite heavy so I'm just trying to get as much information on RAM consumption before jumping off the cliff.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>dolphin_oracle wrote:</cite>

Years ago, when I tried Ubuntu on LiveCD: it worked fine so I installed it on hard-disk but wireless wasn't recognized. This happed with Mageia as well so I'm a little skeptical about live-usb/cd, that's why I'm asking about important features now, <em>before</em> trying it out on live media.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>dirkd wrote:</cite>2. I had no trouble at all with TeXLive full installation.</div></blockquote>
You just typed '$ sudo apt-get install texlive-full'? That simple? No complicated"dummy packages" like 2-2.5 years ago in Debian/Ubuntu distros?</div>

<div class="content">Yup, nothing else. I forgot if I apt-ed or just used synaptics. I switch between them. If I remember well it was a whopping 3 Gb download. Oh, now I remember: it did use synaptics because I remember now that I consciously didn't install some 10 or 20 exotic language packets that were listed along TeX-live in synaptics.<br>
<br>
FYI: attached is the list of all 'known' keyboard parameters that you can use in a freshly installed Antix. Colemak is referenced a few times, so I guess you will be OK. I have a not-so-standard keyboard myself (as hardware that is), and I found configuring it in Antix particularly straightforward.<br>

<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>
So if I install MX instead of AntiX, I get to configure the keyboard else nothing? I'm asking this because in Debian KDE I installed other desktop environments (GNOME, Openbox, LXDE) just to see if they recognized Colemak layout. I first installed Colemak system-wide, through a script using CLI, then configured it via GUI. This went on fine in KDE but the other DE couldn't pick it up and only work with QWERTY.</div></blockquote>
What I meant is that the locale stuff is available in both editions, but the keyboard may be easier to change in MX than in antiX. the colemak keyboard is listed already in the xfce keyboard utility.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>You may have noticed that I did indeed post my hardware info in my original post, I'll just re-post it below for convienience's sake. </div></blockquote>
Ha! I was typing on a phone and had scrolled past them so fast I forgot about them!<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Years ago, when I tried Ubuntu on LiveCD: it worked fine so I installed it on hard-disk but wireless wasn't recognized. This happed with Mageia as well so I'm a little skeptical about live-usb/cd, that's why I'm asking about important features now, before trying it out on live media.</div></blockquote>
No problem asking, however I'm here to tell you if wireless works on the liveCD/usb it will work on the installed system. Wireless, particularly intel wireless, should work just fine. both editions ship with the appropriate firmware preinstalled. the liveMEDIA features are one of those things than makes antiX/MX different from straight debian.</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Moby wrote:</cite>Is it true one needs to install Locale settings from scratch such as keyboard layout? I'd like to configure my system to use Colemak instead of good, ol' QWERTY. (<strong>← This is really important to me!!</strong>)</div></blockquote>
You are in luck! Setting the keyboard varient in antiX live is very easy. Once you have the live system configured the way you want, the settings should carry over when you install. Likewise, for most people, you can set up the locale with the F2-Language and F3-Timezone menus in the live bootloader and this too gets carried over when you installed. You only need to use the F3 menu if your country spans several timezones. <br>
<br>
Type in 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://download.tuxfamily.org/antix/docs-antiX-15/FAQ/boot-params.html#_keyboard_options"<br>linktext was:"kbvar=colemak"<br>====================================<br>
 as a boot parameter to set the keyboard varient. Technically, Colemak is a variant not a layout. The layout is set to"us" by default but it will be customized when you select a language with the F2-Language menu in the live bootloader.<br>
<br>
If you are using a LiveUSB, you can use the F8-Save option to save whatever other boot options you have selected or typed in.</div>

<div class="content">you can also use the"setxkbmap" utility to set your variant after install. to set colemak:<br>

<div class="content">So folks, have you had any chance to check my hardware specifications? A 32-bit processor with ~2GB RAM? What about the Wireless network card?]<br>
<br>
As to the keyboard layout, the"standard" colemak that <strong>dirkd</strong> referred me to in that long list of his, won't do because I need a special <em>Italian</em> language variant. As I said earlier, I installed it on Debian 7 KDE through a script that I downloaded from the Colemak official forums – I'm hoping it's going to work in AntiX too, should I proceed with the installation.<br>
<br>
So…does AntiX operate Fluxbox or IceWM?</div>
