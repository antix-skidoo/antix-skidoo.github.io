<div class="content">I don't know what the purpose of DECnet is in antiX, other than to provide another networking alternative, but I can tell you what DECnet is. Formerly, it was a proprietary network which used a combination of Ethernet and Wide Area Network technologies. It was developed even before TCP/IP became as mature as it is today. DECnet was created by the former Digital Equipment Corporation, hence the DEC initials. <br>
<br>
I was surprised to see it, too. Apparently it was either released in public form, ported, or otherwise made available. Hewlett Packard, who acquired Compaq, (which had merged or acquired Digital a few years before the HP acquisition), may have decided to release the software under a less restrictive license, and that may be why we are seeing it in open projects.<br>
<br>
Perhaps anti can tell us more about how he managed to acquire it and include it in the current release of antiX.</div>

Thanks for that research, SamK! Notice that ffmpeg is in that list; that's a pretty common package. Not sure if the presence of ffmpeg requires the overall DECnet packages; if it does, that seems defective to me and should not be the case.<br>
<br>
I used DECnet during my entire 13 1/2 year career at Digital Equipment Corporation. Some of the sub-protocols within the overall DECnet umbrella were superb. To me, it's main disadvantage to those of us who prefer open software is that - at least in the past - it was not open. Today, if there are disadvantages, I would suggest that unless there have been changes to have it fit seamlessly into modern protocols and infrastructures, it may be out of date. Let's assume that when it became open it was modernized. If that is the case, it is an excellent overall networking infrastructure. It's main disadvantage today would be the obscurity it's lived through compared to the wide adoption of TCP/IP, the variety of protocols in that family, and their prevalence. I think if we compared performance between TCP/IP features and DECnet features that DECnet would look pretty good overall. It's lower visibility and possible age effects would be its greatest challenges.</div>

My main reason for wanting to remove DECnet is that apt-get upgrade is providing a newer version and warning that mac addresses will be changed. It is not needed here so I prefer to avoid potential trouble.</div>

I don't blame you one bit. DECnet was a fantastic product set in its day. I don't know why a MAC address would need to be changed, but that could be a relic from the past, and a possible reason not to use it in this application, even though it has many proven features that have worked great in the past.</div>

I would agree with you on that, though I have not seen any negative adverse effect from having DECnet on my system, other than a bit of extra space used. If my MAC address or anything else has changed, I have not noticed it. Still, if Debian will provide free alternatives that actually consistently work as they should, I would choose them every time.</div>
