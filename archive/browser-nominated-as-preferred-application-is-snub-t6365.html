I have set Midori as my PREFERRED browser (ie using menu"Preferred Applications"). I use Antix-15, XFCE.<br>
Yet, when I click on an Internet link in Synaptic (there are links in some pkg advisories) the system tries to open Iceweasel. [That's exactly where I thought"preferred" works, so it might be a bug (certainly not"preferred" by me).<br>

<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>uhm, well in 13.2 it is not so simple to change for everything to use the new browser you like. (From my findings at least) So good news! With v14/15? we are trying to make it simpler for the end user. However I am not sure the fixes will be able to carry through and update of 13.2 yet. Now as far as I know to set the browser default you will need to<br>
1) set via update-alternatives (update-alternatives --config x-www-browser)<br>
2) set via mime type in /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo*<br>
3) set via mime type (if there) in ~/.local/share/applications<br>
4) change all referances in the menu from iceweasel to your browser (or remove iceweasel and symlink"iceweasel" to"browser")<br>
5) change all referances in the CC like #4<br>
<br>
and probably more that I cannot remember off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
Maybe someone else who has more commonly switched their browsers around can comment (and I can see if I need to fix up the new defaults program for V14/15 <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> )</div></blockquote>

<div class="content">Hello, Any...<br>
<br>
A few days ago <strong>gNewSense-4.0</strong> Linux was released on DistroWatch, so I (naturally) tried installing it. I discovered that it has a SiS driver (for my antique SiS graphics card). It seemed to have no trouble installing. Only today have I had a chance to have a look at it. It uses Gnome-3 yet it is still quite fast. <br>
<br>
As noted at the start of this thread, in Antix I had a <em>"nominated Preferred Application not activating"</em> problem. In gNewSense I stumbled upon the equivalent in a slighly odd place, so I thought I'd tell you of the experience there. <br>
<br>
You can find it under... <br>
<br>
Applications (ie MainMenuButton) &gt; System Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; System Settings &gt; Details <br>
<br>
(There, the left panel has a"Default Applications" option.)<br>
<br>
To test it I nominated Midori as my"Default Application" web-browser. Then I tried to find a web-link in the Synaptic Pkg Mgr (as I had done in Antix) but I couldn't find one. Anyway, instead I opened a blank document and typed a web-link there, then clicked on it - and Midori (my nominated default web browser) popped up straight away.<br>
<br>
If you get a chance to look at it (ie the"Default Applications" application), it is quite good.<br>
<br>
I might be a little spoiled by Mageia-5 which has everything controllable at the GUI level in the MCC (Mageia Control Centre). <br>
<br>
By the way, that reminds me. Yesterday I also loaded the Antix Control Centre pkg using Synaptic but couldn't find any GUI loaded in the Menus. Is there supposed to be one? (I guess I'm asking if the"Antix control centre" exists like Mageia's does - ie controls everything?)<br>
<br>
If there is something I didn't do right to get the"Preferred Application" going then please let me know. <br>
<br>
(Antix is quite good.)<br>
<br>
Regards,</div>

Oh yeah, That could be. The"iceweasel" makes me suspicious though.<br>
<br>
Synaptic runs as root (in MX) or with superuser priveleges (in antiX), so launching the browser from inside of synaptic is probably bad anyway (you will probably end up with a root browser). Right click the links and copy the url. <br>
<br>
I just tried the same action in MX15, and the browser didn't even launch.</div>

<div class="content">Hello, Anticapitalista and dolphin_oracle...<br>
<br>
<br>
According to the install disk, I downloaded Antix-15 full i386, with XFCE4.<br>
<br>
According to cmd: lsb_release -a<br>
<br>
. No LSB modules are available.<br>
. Distributor ID:    antiX<br>
. Description:    antiX 15<br>
. Release:    15<br>
. Codename:    jessie<br>
<br>
[Can I say I tried loading Debian Jessie and couldn't get past go. Same with many Deb-based distros. So Antix-15 was a <em>really nice</em> surprise.]<br>
<br>
By the way, A., I tried MX-15 several months ago and liked it. Unfortunately back then I only had basic graphics, because I could not get the olde SiS graphics working - so I abandoned it some time later. (Left it there for ages, thinking I might end up using it. Could try it again, but Antix is pretty good.)<br>
<br>
&gt; I also have the feeling that I re-installed Antix into THAT partition - but don't take that for certain. (Sorry; I'm just not sure!) However, I usually format partitions before re-use. I really would NOT expect that to be an issue. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, as far as downgrading to Antix13 or MX14, I'm not sure I would do that. [Here's a short side-note as to why not. I tried and older version of PCLinuxOS (2014 32-bit). It <em>had</em> the driver for my SiS card. It was good - <strong>REALLY GOOD</strong>!!! That is, good until I wanted to install LibreOffice (done through a controlled installer) which barked at the old driver; which wasn't upgradeable; which meant I couldn't install LibreOffice until I did; but I couldn't because the driver wasn't supported in upgrades; and anyway"32-bit" was intended to be phased out; so there was... ...and you get my drift? So I hit snags - after <em>really</em> enjoying PCLinuxOS, and intending to use it. So, if I can, I will <strong>avoid</strong> the problem of using distros that don't support my hardware/drivers in any upgrades, and have no real future (on my system, that is).]<br>
<br>
Back to"Preferred Browser" issue... <br>
<br>
I just typed a web-link into a Libre doc, clicked on it, and it launched <strong>Midori</strong> (ie my"Preferred Browser"). So you might be right about the"root-privilege" thing, dolph. Want me to try it any other way? Or, is this settled now? <br>
<br>
.<br>
.<br>
[If you are wondering about the integrity of my Antix install (esp Anticapitalista) I am a bit too. If the above is NOT settled then I mention the following as a potential issue - otherwise to be ignored...<br>
<br>
dolph, in another thread you showed me a screenshot of your menus (because I had a menu discrepancy when compared to your setup). On my Antix-XFCE NONE of my sub-menus have sub-menus. That is to say, it seems a very"flat" based menu system. As we've discussed, I have NO <em>"Preferences"</em> sub-menu like yours, and my <em>"Main Menu"</em> button (atop screen) reads [/I]"Application Menu"[/I] - which your screenshot showed as a <span style="text-decoration: underline">sub-menu</span> on your system. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, I must <span style="text-decoration: underline">clarify</span> here that yesterday I did NOT install an Antix-CC pkg, I UPGRADED the Antix-cc-full pkg (I think that was the name). <br>
<br>
However, just now, when I checked the correct"-cc-" pkg name in Synaptic it is showing as NO"...-cc-..." pkgs installed, and"antix-cc-antix" as <em>not installed-&amp;-<strong>upgradeable</strong></em>. (I have <em>not</em> attempted to re-install that yet.)<br>
<br>
So if you still think there is some issue (about the above"Preferred App") issue, then perhaps take this into account also? (I can do another thread if that is preferred.)]<br>
<br>
Kind Regards,</div>

<div class="content">PCLOS packages it's own applications, no? With it's own server and package maintainers. Kinda like Stevo and them at Mepis with the Testing repos for MX and Mepis 11. Or am I mistaken? <br>
<br>
Not like AntiX which is Debian only unless you add a repo. Hence the Libre Office package conflict in a old PCLOS install. Wheezy in MX-14 is running fine and Dandy on one of my old boxes and is updating easily just fine. I ran AntiX 11 with testing repos enabled the longest time till recently on one box till I decided I wanted Stevo's and Anti's new antixcc instead of what shipped in AntiX 11. <br>
<br>
So I think your fears are unfounded on that issue comparing AntiX to PCLOS.<br>
<br>
I would just apt pin xorg for that sis chip so xorg does not upgrade from a AntiX 13 install and just fly with that.</div>
