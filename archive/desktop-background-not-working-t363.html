<div class="content">Hi comsparks,<br>
<br>
I'm another non-user of gnome (I don't like it, but each to his/her own)<br>
so my advice is limited.<br>
When you installed gnome, did you do<br>
apt-get install gnome-desktop environment<br>
<br>
I think this brings everything that gnome desktop has to offer, whereas an apt-get install gnome selects the base(ic) libs and apps.<br>
<br>
I could well be wrong, but have a look in synaptic and see if there is anything there that looks like it needs to be installed to get what you want. ie what app is 'responsible for changing the desktop.<br>
<br>
Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Hey, I"ll take that as a compliment!<br>
<br>
If you want to compare kde with gnome (speed wise), you could install a minimal kde desktop with kde-base. It is also very fast on antiX.<br>
<br>
antiX uses a lot of gnome apps rather than kde ones as it is much easier to keep the distro size down. Now, this is good on the one hand for those that like a less integrated desktop environment, a sort of mix-and-match (ie me), but for a fully integrated desktop, I think kde is the best. Now I say that even though I never use kde anymore (except to see what is going on in test distros I like ie sidux). Sure kde is 'bloated' for those with less than 256 MB RAM, but with higher RAM it does work fast.<br>
<br>
Back to your problem. I really have no idea what is missing. Maybe xtoecutter will pop in and give his experience as he installed gnome to the antiX-base.<br>
<br>
I think I should really push this base.iso more. From feedback, it has been pretty successful in installing gnome, kde, xfce and enlightenment and not breaking on the next (dist)-upgrade.<br>
<br>
enjoy antiX comsparks</div>

Sorry I can't be of more help with Gnome. I think as far as the apps are concerned, the gnome stuff is based on gtk which I believe is why there faster. Myself, for a full desktop, I prefer XFCE. It also uses gtk and is alot faster than gnome or kde.<br>
<br>
When I want simplicity I switch over to Fluxbox. I have also installed E16 but I have a lot to learn about it. Imight just try to roll a E16/17 version of Antix. Maybe AntiE.<br>

<div class="content">Well I really appreciate all the help. I test a lot of distributions looking for the Holy Grail. Some have come close. Eriefisher, I too have checked those out as well and yes it's still a learning process. Anticapitalista, this too is a fine distribution and one to be considered as a keeper. I have erase and reloaded the Basic several times loading Gnome various ways but still come up with the same quirks. After digging deeper I found other things that weren't working up to par. I would tell you but I've lost my notepad. I think my cat hid it! Again! I've have since reloaded Ubuntu and filed the Basic for future study. I've found Ubuntu to be very stable and runs any Gnome application I throw at it. It's really up to the individual and their tastes as to what works right for them and Ubuntu seems to meet my needs between testing period. Thanks again.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know if this helps or if it's related, but perhaps I had a similar problem: Before there was antixfce, I installed xfce on top of antix. It seemed to run fine until I tried changing gtk2 themes. At this point, things got weird - it was as if the antix and the xfce theme changers were struggling for control of the task. I believe I just kept going back and forth between the two apps until it worked. I wonder if something like this is happening to you?<br>
