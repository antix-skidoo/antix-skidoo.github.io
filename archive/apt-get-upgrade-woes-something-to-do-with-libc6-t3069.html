<div class="content">I posted the headaches I've been through this weekend at the tail end of another thread:<br>
viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=3055<br>
I realized that since that thread is solved, chances are, few if any will read my tacked-on-the-end posts. So I'll start a new thread.<br>
<br>
Basically, I nuked my MEPIS 8.5 system when I foolishly decided to try upgrading from Lenny repos to Testing repos. Not a problem for those with knowledge, perhaps; but I tend to wade into things that are over my head.<br>
<br>
Anyway, couldn't boot after installing Testing. Hours of frustration trying to figure-out what happened. Re-installing MEPIS 8.5 worked, sort-of. Then I got stupid again, and tried updating to Stable. I figured the problem might have been updating two levels (Lenny to Wheezy). Well, one level was enough, and I was back to a non-bootable (to X, anyway) system.<br>
<br>
Using a spare computer to search through forums, I noticed mention of problems with"libc6" updgrades, for various distros. Each time I tried upgrading through apt-get, I encountered messages telling me I needed to manually stop xdm or kdm (might not have those spelled right) and a bunch of other stuff; in connection with libc and/or glibc. <br>
<br>
This may or may not be the only problem. Rokytnji identified a problem in the thread linked-to above, which had to do with separate root and home partitions; which I tend to use. See the thread linked-to above for details. It gets solved by using UUID (whatever that is) labels for drives, rather than /dev/sda1-type labelling - both in Grub and /etc/fstab.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I can now boot into X; after modifying menu.lst and /ect/fstab with the UUID stuff. But I'm still scared to do a full apt-get dist-upgrade! I have done so probably half-a-dozen times this weekend, and each time I end up with either total inability to boot (if I installed Grub to root) or command-line-only (if I installed Grub to the MBR or whatever it's called). <br>
<br>
I don't really understand all the various posts about libc6; but I'm pretty sure it's involved.<br>
<br>
Any and all thoughts on this pesky dilemma are most welcome!<br>
<br>

<div class="content">Are you using antiX-M8.5?<br>
<br>
If so it might be better to download the rc version of M11 here:<br>

<div class="content">Hi Anti! Yep, running 8.5. Because I tend to break things while mucking about in ignorance, I thought I'd wait until version 11 has all the bugs worked-out in the final version. Would you say it's close enough? If so, I'll try it.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>

<div class="content">Do you have nvidia driver?<br>
<br>
If so maybe wait, or read the latest announcement for applying a patch to that rc iso file.<br>
<br>
If you have something else, then the iso should work just fine. The bugs are mainly to do with running live or using nvidia.</div>

<div class="content">Uh... I don't know if I have the nvidia driver. I might. One of the many things I messed-about with this weekend was Xorg.conf. I broke it at one point, and got it working again by commenting out a bunch of nvidia stuff. Not sure that really indicates much.<br>
<br>
I think I may play it safe, and run this very basic antiX 8.5 installation which I'm now working with; until antiX 11 final hits the mirrors. I'm all out of time for this weekend, and can't afford to bumble my way into another mess; as I need a functioning computer for one of my jobs. <br>
<br>
BTW, this all started because I have been pondering for some time how to"synchronize" (so to speak) my desktops and netbook. I was running MEPIS on the desktops, and love it; but as it used older debian repos, the software was dated compared to my netbook. I wanted to be able to easily move back and forth between computers for work.<br>
<br>
My goal is to have all computers running antiX, with an LXDE desktop. I know LXDE isn't preferred by the community; but I kinda like it. Anyway, my point is: I pondered for quite awhile which distro I would"commit" to on all machines. In the end, I had to conclude that antiX was the way to go. I've tried a number of distros; and they're all good. For me, antiX offers the things that matter to me: light-on-resources, full-featured, and easy enough for a perpetual noob like me to use (with a little help from the forums...)<br>
