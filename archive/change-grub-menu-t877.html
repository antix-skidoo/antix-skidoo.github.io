<div class="content">As the question asks, should the next antiX have a new grub menu look?<br>
<br>
I'm thinking, yes, to make it more consistent with the default antiX theme (basically blackish like antiX- VETÃ‹VENDOSJE!) or blue (again) like antiX-Lysistrata.<br>
Also to use the antiX 'logo' rather than the MEPIS one.<br>
<br>
Ideas, suggestions sought, including alternative colours.<br>
<br>
There is a wealth of talent here that needs to be tapped into.</div>

<div class="content">I agree. I would like to see one of sakasa's darker walls or perhaps a new one used with the antix logo. Maybe even the red one from impuwat. Of course sakasa has great fonts that could be used as well. I think it's a great idea. Perhaps even the caption"Lean and Mean" could be a part of the grub splash as well.<br>

<div class="content">I think a custom grub menu would be nice. It would lend a more polished and consistent feeling to the antiX environment. I'm willing to assist as needed.<br>
<br>
I appreciate John's vote of confidence in the my antix royal red wallpaper but it doesn't lend itself well to being stretched to the different resolutions. Sakasa carefully crafts his wallpapers with that consideration in mind. The best wallpapers are made for a particular resolution. When I download one of Sakasa's that I like I still take the time to re-size or crop it with Gimp for my particular resolution. It's usually sharper and more defined that way.<br>
<br>
My vote would be to work off whatever default wallpaper Anti chooses to use. It wouldn't have to be a repeat of the wallpaper but it should incorporate similar and complementary colors. I like the idea of incorporating"lean and mean" as well. That's a very apt description of antiX.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to start on some rough drafts to offer for consideration. I would appreciate input and guidance.</div>

<div class="content">Definitely a good idea to make the Grub screen more"antiX-Centric". As for colours etc, maybe see what the artists in the forum can come up with and then choose the one that works best?</div>

<div class="content">I agree that a new grub menu would be good for consistency in the artwork. I also agree that the AntiX logo should be used.<br>
<br>
I like the idea suggested of using blue as the color for the grub menu and the default wallpaper. Most people like blue and it is an attractive color. This is just my personal thoughts, there is nothing wrong with using black either.<br>
<br>
I would like to see Sakasa's artwork featured. Sakasa does fine work and has done a great deal in the way of artwork for AntiX. I would be disappointed if I did not see Sakasa's<br>
artwork as the default.<br>
<br>
Possibly get with Sakasa and discuss the style and color for a new look? The metallic style of lettering being used in recent wallpapers has a nice polished look, just a suggestion.<br>
<br>
These are just ideas and I would be interested in other people's thoughts on this.<br>
<br>
One more thing, I appreciate that this topic is open for discussion.I am sure the next version of AntiX will look great!</div>

<div class="content">Ok all.<br>
<br>
How should we do this?<br>
Do you think we should just float ideas or get a group of you to be some sort of artwork team?<br>
Sakasa has produced a huge amount of wallpaper for antiX, and M7.2 uses his artwork.<br>
<br>
I'll be fairly flexible with what is produced, but I prefer using smallish icons, logos, like what has been produced so far from Spartacus to Vetevendosje.</div>

<div class="content">Here are some of my thoughts and preferences on this issue, for what it's worth.<br>
<br>
My suggestion would be to first choose the default wallpaper. Anti...This is your baby so it's up to you. You choose and we could give input by letting you know what our favorites are, or if you wanted a committee that would be fine as well. I'm sure Sakasa would be open to modding and assisting as needed.<br>
<br>
Once the default wallpaper is decided on we can begin to work on some rough drafts of various grub menus for you to pick from.<br>
<br>
I think the simpler designs with minimal logos have been received well and is the wisest course. BTB seems to be getting good comments in some of the antiX reviews I've read. I like simple text but I also really like Sakasa's design with the X enlarged and in the center of the text.<br>
<br>
My favorite <strong>darker</strong> Sakasa walls are: ATB, BTB, Supar, Tornas, Cuarco, Galvesy. Of those I like BTB, Cuarco, and Tornas the best. <br>
<br>
Here are a few comments on these three...<br>
<br>
I would prefer to see the text for BTB in maybe a light gray (like the look just a little better with the antix style and the gray min, max, and close buttons). My only concern with BTB is that some of my old monitors just can't pull some of the subtlety out (have to turn the brightness way up). I'm not sure if BTB could be lightened just a touch or not.<br>
<br>
Cuarco has some color and again I would prefer to see the text in the lower right hand corner, smaller, and a color that would coordinate with the antix style. <br>
<br>
Tornas might be the most visually exciting and works well with monitors of different brightness levels. It might be a little too busy for some people but it is excellent art. A small discrete gray logo in the right corner would really be attractive.<br>
<br>
My favorite <strong>blue</strong> Sakasa walls are: Lubend, Grepia, Porum, and Xemiral. Grepia probably my favorite.<br>
<br>
Other colors: I really liked the purple BTB Sakasa made at OU812's request<br>
<br>
On a side note....where is the file located in antix for the mepis artwork for grub? I didn't really locate the file. Doing a little research I found the following Howto:Grub Splash Images on the Ubuntu forums...
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://ph.ubuntuforums.com/showthread.php?s=c8e013f848912dfb02e90c7d9bf7acef&amp;t=30341"<br>linktext was:"http://ph.ubuntuforums.com/showthread.p ... ef&amp;t=30341"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
In the howto it was noted the artwork would have to be limited to 640 X 480 and only contain a maximum of 14 colors. The artwork has to be saved in xpm.gz. My question is will we have to follow the same constraints? Or is the Mepis grub splash artwork utilizing a different method in antiX? If so are there any constraints there as well? What formats can we use...svg, png, jpeg?</div>

I used Anti's link to extract /boot/grub/message and found the existing back.jpg seen here:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.imageposter.com/uploads/get/444832" class="postlink"><img src="http://www.imageposter.com/storage/t109/94910back.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
<br>
I then took a few minutes to create a new antiX test image that corresponded fairly closely to the Mepis grub background, seen here:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.imageposter.com/uploads/get/444834" class="postlink"><img src="http://www.imageposter.com/storage/t109/70897new-back.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
<br>
This was just a test to familiarize myself with the process so I didn't concern myself with too much detail in the test image. Both images are 800 X 600 and jpg format.<br>
<br>
I then followed the guide to copy the new test image into the archive. To see if I had done it correctly I extracted message and noted that my new test image was there as back.jpg<br>
<br>
I then renamed the old message as message.bak and replaced it with the new. I rebooted and found I just had a black background at grub with the kernel options listed. No test image. I checked menu.lst and commented out the fancy color line. Still nothing.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if there is something about the new image that doesn't conform to some standard or if (the more likely scenario) I'm just overlooking something. Any help would be appreciated.</div>

Maybe you can look at the old grub image pixels and resolution and change the one you are working on or trying to work on to be exact in dimension as the old grub. You can do this in seeing the old in Gimp: Image/image properties/. <br>
Then take the new one and change it to the same dimensions , pixels, resolution. You can do this through Gimp also Image/scaleimage. Hope this helps. I do not know how Antix or what resolution antix uses for grub. You can do the changes with most graphics applications. To which ever you are accostume to. Sorry about the delay I'm chnaging all my OS lately and still working on it. I will be free soon to get involve.<br>

<div class="content">Thanks John. I like the general look but didn't really take too much time to make it"pretty". Just put somethng together to experiment with the process. Simple text, a rectangle, and a few drop shadows.<br>
<br>
Sakasa: Thanks for the response. I did make it the same resolution/size as the default Mepis image....800 X 600. I also tried to keep it very close in general format. I also made it jpg like the original. The file size is a little larger than the Mepis default, however. Hopefully later tonight I can try a similar version that might be smaller in file size or a little simpler.<br>
<br>
I still wonder if I'm overlooking something in menu.lst that might be affecting things. I found several good Grub menu wiki/how to's and studied through them to no avail.<br>
<br>
I'll keep trying. I would like someone else to give the process an attempt and show me the error of my ways <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
