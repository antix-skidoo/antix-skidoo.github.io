<div class="content">I am trying to pare this distro down to the bare workable bones. There are some services I must have running, such as CUPS, some I knew I could disable (i.e., lighttpd), and some, such a cryptdisk, that I at first thought I could disable but then questioned after looking in Synaptic as to what their function is.<br>
<br>
Could you post a"must not disable" list of services for antiX so we know what must be there to boot up? I was tempted to go by your"don't mess with this" comments in disabling services, but that is sort of suicidal. But maybe the"don't mess with this" list is the answer. <br>
<br>
When one is running a 160mb RAM system such as mine, every spare byte helps. <br>
<br>
By the way, I found a combo this evening that will bring an antiX distro running on a 266 w/ 160mb RAM to its knees: Spamassassin loaded and running, IceWeasel and Streamtuner. Spamassassin was, I think, the worst offender since stuff got better after I disabled that. <br>

In partly answering my own question ...<br>
<br>
Did some research this morning into what each service that I still have enabled does. I think I almost have to keep the following services enabled to do what I want to do on the computer: dbus-daemon, dlclient3 (dhcp), dirmngr (certificates), mpd (music), powersaved (suspend mode), and udevd (hotplug). Probably could turn off cron, klogd and syslogd but I doubt if any of those are eating up too much RAM. <br>

<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Using the cheatcode lean will stop the following daemons from running:<br>
rsync, lighttpd, mpd, cupsysd, powersaved.<br>
<br>
Open sysvconfig and uncheck the ones you know you definitely do not need.<br>
<br>
mpd isn't needed if you play audio from xmms, butis needed if you want to use ncmpc command-line audio app.</div>

Thanks for the info. I use xmms for all music. <br>
<br>
Knew about sysvconfig; that is where I was doing the experimenting. <br>
<br>
Will let you know of improvements and/or issues after doing this.</div>

<div class="content">Forgot to mention that spamassassin should be called ramassassin.<br>
<br>
I really do not like this app and that is why it is not installed by default.<br>
If you can get used to sylpheed-claws, you will appreciate how fast and light it is, with a lot of nice features too including the 'spam' filter called bogofilter. (I don't think it is installed by default).<br>
<br>
Here is a page for sylpheed-claws plugins.<br>
