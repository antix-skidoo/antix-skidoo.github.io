anti, I was able to test systemd with an antiX-base configuration with the 3.3.5 kernel and got it working. At first, I did not have the systemd packages installed and I was getting kernel failures, but then I installed them, and using the init=/bin/systemd line, it worked.<br>
<br>
With the current state of systemd, I really did not see any significant advantage at this point to using it, but at least it's working. As I mentioned in the thread, I recommend leaving this in an experimental state at this stage, but it DOES work with the latest kernel.</div>

As for the systemd, it boots noticeably faster, but it throws up a bunch of"errors" but it does work.<br>

I am trying to look into the errors, and will get some times later<br>

I will also try the libre kernel.<br>

Hi Brian (from another"Brian"!)<br>
<br>
There are not any stringent requirements for testing. Getting as many different people, with different systems, different experience levels, and different hardware is what helps us to locate different kinds of problems, and the different perspectives we all bring helps us to create a more well rounded system and experience for as many different kinds and types of users as possible.<br>
<br>
The one thing that is needed her is to test the current software that is in development, that is, antiX M12.0"Pre-final". You can choose whichever"flavor" or variant you want, and you can run it live, install it on a hard disk, run it from a USB, or all of the above, if you so choose. There are the"full","base", and"core" variations to choose from. Depending on your experience level, you may want to run Live first, get a feel for what's available, and try the"full" version first, then if you find that easy enough to deal with, move on to others if you'd like.<br>
<br>
We like to get a report of your system configuration. Running the command: inxi -Fxz from the command line in a terminal window and pasting the results of that from your newly installed system can be helpful, especially if you encounter any issues.<br>
<br>
You can install on new or old hardware, with one system there, or on a system where you dual boot or multi boot; that makes no difference, and it's good to have the diversity in what we test.<br>
<br>
Check around the forum to see what kinds of reports that others have sent in the past, and do something similar. If you have problems or questions, any of us would be glad to help you out; we all started somewhere in this process! <br>
<br>
Thanks for offering to help out; we appreciate it!<br>

Hi Brian, (nice to have another Brian around! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> )<br>
<br>
what you wrote in your post was pretty much what I thought, but I like to ask to make sure. For instance, I thought that testers usually had a PC that they used"only" for testing, seeing that there might be bugs or problems of some sort. I won't be dual booting (at least not with Windows anymore), but I do occasionally like trying out AntiX on different machines. I must say that it's one of the fastest I've tried (I've tried about 20-30 different distros in the last few months, just to see how they perform.).<br>
<br>
Still, many things are still new to me. But the gratification of learning to do things correctly to get things working well, is great.<br>
The command you mentioned, inxi, was new to me.<br>
At the moment, I'm writing from my oldest PC, and so I tried the inxi command, without the final"z" since I got an error for putting it. Here's the result:<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>System:    Host antiX1 Kernel 2.6.36-1-mepis-smp i686 (32 bit) Distro antiX-M11-686 Jayaben Desai 01 May 2011

I have AntiX on a slightly newer machine, in the office. Works fine. (I haven't tried AntiX 12 yet, but I'll probably either use it live, or install it to the HD. As I'm also getting into making music on my PCs, I'd be especially inspired to do a full install on a third PC, if the kernel had low latency.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm having lots of fun since I discovered Linux and AntiX, and I might be able to contribute in other ways too, in the future. We'll see...<br>

<div class="content">The"z" option is a relatively recent addition to inxi.<br>

-F Show Full output for inxi. Includes all Upper Case line letters, plus -s and -n.<br>

-x Show extra data (only works with verbose or line output, not short form): <br>

Try running inxi with the -U option with root access enabled, and that will upgrade inxi to the latest version, and then you will have access to the z option. <br>

Try running inxi with the -U option with root access enabled, and that will upgrade inxi to the latest version, and then you will have access to the z option. <br>

Just an update: I installed AntiX 12 (full) on this (other) desktop! Installed without a hitch. --Well, except one: I use an Italian keyboard, so I selected"it." But it installed an English set-up. So I went into /etc/default/keyboard and changed"us" to"it" and rebooted. Now everything's good to go. I did the updates and all's well! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

<div class="content">Cool, and that is good information. The fact that you could switch to an Italian-based keyboard is good; the fact that, as far as you know, you attempted to select one from the start, but it did not initially get configured that way is a source of concern and a potential defect.<br>
<br>
Do as much testing as you can in that area; I am sure anti would like to improve any inconsistencies that you find, assuming we can reproduce them and locate the cause of the issues.<br>
<br>
Thanks for getting started; much appreciated!</div>

No problem. (I was able to solve it because it happened on M11, too, and I wrote down the solution. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> )<br>
<br>
BTW: I'd like to install apps like Jack and Audacity and some virtual synths, but I see nothing in the repositories. Am I missing something?<br>

Yes, I did a reload. Only 3 results for"jack." No QJackCtl, Jackd, etc.. Same for Audacity. (There are others I'd like to use, and they were all in the repos of M11.)<br>
<br>
I can speak Italian well, although I'm from the US. But I live here in Italy with my Italian wife. I might be able to help with translations, although the grammar retouches would have to be done by a mothertongue..<br>
