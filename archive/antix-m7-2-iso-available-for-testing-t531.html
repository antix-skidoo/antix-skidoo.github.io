<div class="content">antiX-M7.2.iso (c320MB) is available for testing. (I forgot to rename the file beta1).<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/antix/iso"<br>linktext was:"http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/antix/iso"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
(Hopefully available elsewhere soon, but we're having power-cuts here so I can't upload).<br>
Also available here:<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://tomlinux.ca/testing"<br>linktext was:"http://tomlinux.ca/testing"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
To download, user=antiXtester and password=fluxbox<br>
<br>
<br>
Dist-upgraded to 16 March 2008.<br>
New inclusions:<br>
wicd<br>
ceni (command line network, from sidux)<br>
transmission (torrent)<br>
gmpc (front end to mpd music daemon)<br>
rox-terminal<br>
geany replaces scite<br>
claws-mail replaces sylpheed-claws-gtk1 <br>
aumix-gtk replaces aumix cli<br>
gnome-commander replaces xfe<br>
<br>
and a basic antiXcc (thanks to OU812).<br>
<br>
At the moment I have kept the same graphics as Lysistrata, but they will be changed when antiX-M7.3 goes final.<br>
I have removed ipw3945d to speed up booting. If you have this wireless card then you'll need to install it.<br>
The kernel is the same version, but has been patched to fix the vmsplice() issue.<br>
UnicornRider scripts are still included with adjustments for lean cheatcode. <br>
Extra UnicornRider script to (hopefully) auto-remove the proc errors when booting the newly installed antiX.<br>
<br>
There is no need for users to remove their existing antiX-M7(.01).<br>
Could testers please give feedback particularly about wicd, ceni and whether the proc messages during boot disappear when installed.<br>
<br>
Have fun!</div>

I am pretty sure removing ipw3945d is going to affect quite a few wireless users.<br>

<div class="content">During default start up:<br>
mount failed for selinuxfs on /selinux: no such file or directory<br>
configuring xorg graphical display hung forever<br>
dhclient still pounded eth0 for an ip address wasting a few more seconds.<br>
I didn't see the proc messages because fstab has been fixed<br>
These are most likely mepis issues<br>
<br>
wireless failed of course because of the lack of ipw3945d<br>
<br>
Apps:<br>
geany rocks as usual<br>
rxvt for terminal is a good choice<br>
antixcc zenity script is pretty cool and simple<br>
ceni people were complaining about having to type their password whereas with wicd they didn't have to. If you want to solve this I have a very basic version of a suid C wrapper working (I posted it and I'm sure you saw it). I will be rewriting it in the next week or so for at least myself and I will try to post it as a deb package for those who are too lazy to do it the manual way.</div>

<div class="content">Nice work, anti. I installed it on a 400Mhz Celeron desktop box with 256 MB SDRAM. The HD is divided as follows: Root = 5GB &amp; change; Swap = 1 GB &amp; change; Home = 7GB &amp; change; DataStorage = 5 GB &amp; change.<br>
<br>
The livecd loaded from insert to login in 2min 43.29sec. The actual install took 6min 31.20sec. First reboot to login took 1min 49.65 sec. The whole process took about 10 minutes: No Surprise There.<br>
<br>
I've only looked around a little bit so far. I like the Royal Read wallpaper. The control center, while I understand its value (especially for new users) and even voted for its inclusion, will take some getting used to. In an odd way, it sort of takes some of the fun out of using fluxbox. But, hey, it can always be removed or simply ignored. Claws works fine (was using sylpheed-claws-gtk). gnome-commander is okay but I personally prefer xfe (probably because I'm used to it). <br>
<br>
I'll poke around"under the hood" some in a couple of days. For now, it looks good &amp; works smoothly. Nice work! Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">tried it briefly in virtualbox:<br>
<br>
GnomeCommander: can't set/edit mime types, it seems to rely on Gnome systemwide settings. I added leafpad as default application for .txt files in gnome-commander but it still didn't work for opening them (though I could open leafpad to make a new text file using shift + the editor icon in the toolbar), instead offering me a prompt to set the association in Control Centre. I assume it means Gnome Control Centre. Also Gnome-Commander by default expects to find gedit, fileroller etc. It seems to need fileroller to be able to handle archives via its plug-in system. I thought I might be able to get it all set up by installing and using gconf-editor but it seems it really does need Gnome Control Centre to set systemwide preferences for it to be useful. I think 2x rox-filer tabbed is better than this. For a good two pane manager emelfm2 is way better (being desktop agnostic) but I know it isn't in the repos. For samba browsing perhaps smbc or Linneighborhood or pyneighborhood would fill the gap. <br>
<br>
Wicd: seems fine, though the daemon is not running by default. Probably this will not be obvious to people who didn't use it before. <br>
<br>
Roxterm seems excellent. I like having built in tabbing in terminal. <br>
<br>
Geany is a good replacement, it's also the default in Zenwalk and I noticed it's very fast for opening xml files. <br>
<br>
aumix-gtk looks great<br>
<br>
Transmission is excellent choice imo, is already the bittorrent client I choose anyway. <br>
<br>
I like the antixcc</div>

<div class="content">1. wicd worked for me. in fact, it was easier to set up than mnetwork and ceni.<br>
2. gmpc did not work for me - I can't access my music folders. I remember having trouble trying to set it up before, maybe you'll have better luck. if you can't get it working properly, i would like to once again suggest that alsaplayer gui and alsaplayer cli replace xmms, gmpc, and nmpc.<br>
3. sorry to hear that gnome-commander may turn out to be a bust. has anyone gotten emelfm to install from the repo? that may be a good option if gnome-commander is a bust. (has emelfm2 appeared in the repos yet? that may be another option). otherwise, i'd be fairly happy with rox + mc.<br>
4. thanks for including icewm. i am really beginning to like it and would like to see it stay.<br>
5. booting up was not noticeably different from 7.1. same errors, same problems with dhcpd.<br>

<div class="content">Thanks for the feedback so far.<br>
<br>
For livecd or fromiso, could you test out the cheatcodes<br>
<br>
* nogui = slim login manager is disabled.<br>
* lean = cupsd, lighttpd, rsync, powersaved and mpd are disabled at boot.<br>
* mean = disables network ie you will have to manually configure net connection via wicd, ceni or Mepis network<br>
* kbd=ch = sets a Swiss-German keyboard <br>
* mean dhcX = sets network after rc5 and sets dhclient&amp; in /etc/rc.local<br>
<br>
or a combination of cheats.<br>
<br>
Hopefully for the next beta release, there will be some more cheatcodes to shorten boot time, especially for the livecd.<br>
The next beta will have a 'fix' for dhclient at boot, I hope.</div>

<div class="content">I know there is another thread listing"wishes" but here are some more thoughts on the issue:<br>
<br>
1. include a pim such as osmo (in repo). i had suggested plan before, but osmo is much nicer.<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://clay.ll.pl/osmo/"<br>linktext was:"http://clay.ll.pl/osmo/"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
2. maybe just keep rox + mc and let user install pcmanfm, emelfm, etc.<br>
<br>
3. tidy up the right-click menu. perhaps have users submit ideas as we did with conky.<br>
<br>
4. any way to resolve the issue with libglib1.2? i can't install fbmenu from source, icecc and emelfm from repo, or use some components of icewmcp because of this dependency error. i would love to see it resolved.<br>
<br>
5. would like to see more linux links included in iceweasel: open-box.org, linux.softpedia.com, 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.customize.org/fluxbox"<br>linktext was:"www.customize.org/fluxbox"<br>====================================<br>
, etc.<br>
<br>
6. if there's room, i would like to see a search engine such as catfish come with the iso.<br>
<br>
7. again, please keep icewm. in the end, if you don't i can always install it myself.<br>
<br>
8. did some updates recently and evince was installed. very nice app. i think this was more of a debian thing than an antix thing. is it going to be included? it's pretty cool.<br>
<br>
9. you may want to edit the antixcc file to lengthen the"view window" - it's a little short. try adding 20 or 30 to the current value and see if that helps.<br>

<div class="content">Thanks for the comments OU812.<br>
<br>
1. Will have a look at it.<br>
2. I probably will remove gnome-commander and use rox + mc<br>
3. Good idea. Suggestions welcome.<br>
4. Try aptitude install emelfm and see what choices it offers. Not very nice!<br>
5. Will do. Suggestions anyone?<br>
6. Catfish added.<br>
7. Icewm will stay.<br>
8. I think evince gets automatically installed with some app (and upgraded) but I can't remember which one. It will not be included as it (plus dependencies) take up 33.7MB.<br>
9. How do I do this? I'm using your script, I just added a few lines.<br>

<div class="content">Would you post the script please or pm me the script? Or just wait until I can fire up the new test iso. The machine I was testing it on had a few too many experiments and so I decided to wax nostalgic and install a slackware-based distro - of course forgot to do a backup. When 7.3 goes final, I'll just reinstall it everywhere.<br>
<br>
BTW: I have a partition that I was using for storing games, backups, music, etc. It is behaving badly. Can't wait until 7.3 goes final to fix the problem - with a reinstall (backup this time. Plug: if you have a spare internal hdd that you would like to convert into an external hdd, I would like to recommend the nexstar 3 by vantec. It stays cool, looks sharp, easy to install)!<br>

<div class="content">Since you like cli apps, anti, you may want to consider adding mybashburn to the iso. It shouldn't add a lot of weight. I've used it before and it's excellent. It can be a bit cumbersome reconfiguring it every now and then, but it's probably the best cli burner around.<br>

<div class="content">I was thinking: sometimes I do updates and apps get installed or uninstalled according to the sid repos. Sometimes this has been good, others mixed results. My idea is this: how about having the stable repos enabled by default and the sid repos available (in sources.list), but disabled. This way if a user feels adventurous, they can always make the switch to sid on their own (either by editing sources.list or using the prefs in synaptic). Thanks.<br>

<div class="content">My experience with M7.2 beta is as expected: no problems. Wicd works well. I like aumix - quick, simple, easy. I'm also glad to see gqview included. The antiXcc takes some getting used to. While it works great and is extremely easy to use, I still find myself going through a terminal to edit the various configurations. Old habits die hard, I suppose. <br>
<br>
Now, for suggestions: Keep links2 and oust Dillo. I would not include Nano, Gnome Commander, Ceni, or Geany as pre-installed packages. Keep leafpad and maybe add Ted. None of these are major issues for me, though, just a few thoughts. <br>
<br>
Thanks, anti<br>
<br>
Edit: While I haven't done any sceintific testing this"feels" to be the quickest antiX yet.</div>
