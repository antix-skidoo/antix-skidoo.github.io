<div class="content">I've found several threads concerning the subject, but no satisfying results. Here is my experience:<br>
Compaq Armadas, models 71xx, 72xx, 7400, 7800. Well, I'm not real sure about the first two. All are similar. 256mb max (mine generally have at least 200mb), P1 or P2, 166mhz-366mhz. I think the 7400 and 7800 have USB but it is not bootable. For years I've had trouble reading CDRs but I solved that problem by getting a CD-RW drive. I have Ubuntu 6.06 on several, everything works on 6.06; as I recall I had to copy some stuff from an older Ubuntu to get 6.06 to work. Some changes since 6.06 have kept me from getting a newer Ubuntu working. The older Ubuntus supported the 1024x768 resolution; the newer ones use VESA at only 600x800. These would make great internet terminals for me if I could get a newer FireFox working.<br>
<br>
I recently tried to use AntiX-M11-486 live and failed with the subject message."nodma" and"rootdelay=15" did me no good.<br>
As outlined above, I don't believe I have a CD drive problem. In fact, I used 6.06 to burn a CD on the drive that needs to read it.<br>
<br>
I don't believe this problem is local to Mepis/AntiX. A year or so ago, I tried several other Debian derivatives that, as I recall, exhibited the same problem. Mint. An older AntiX, I think. Some others. So, semi-clearly, this is a problem that has been introduced somewhere along the way by developers. There are a lot of old laptops not being used because of it. I'm eager to hear of success stories of AntiX on 486s, P1s and P2s.</div>

<div class="content">There were many changes in the upcoming release of antiX to fix the"can't find antiX filesystem" problem you ran into.<br>
<br>
But before you download a pre-release iso and burn a new LiveCD, 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingACPI"<br>linktext was:"this page"<br>====================================<br>
 suggests some boot options you can try. They also suggest you try booting without the"quiet" option in order to see more messages from the kernel. Perhaps the first thing to try would be the"failsafe" boot option. You can get help about other boot options that might help solve your problem by hitting the &lt;F1&gt; key at the Grub boot menu. Then select the"Boot Options" menu option. You might want to write some of them down.<br>
<br>
Since your system used to boot and now no longer does, it is very likely the problem is a result of a Linux kernel upgrade. The kernel is constantly evolving to deal with all the changes in PC hardware. Almost always there are boot options available that will allow you to boot older machines. The trick is to find which boot options are needed for your particular machine. It might be worthwhile to Google the model name along with"Linux" to see if someone else has already solved the problem for you. I looked around but I mostly found older posts about getting all the bits of hardware to work after a successful boot.</div>

Thanks. I tried"acpi=off" and got no joy. Will try the other suggestions above later. Meanwhile, I went looking for the pre-release ISO and didn't find it. Where should I be looking?</div>

You can find it here:

I didn't post the link because I suspect you will need to use a boot code to solve the problem whether you use the new iso or not. The new iso might help a little because you won't need to use the rootdelay option. It will try 10 times, pausing 1 second in between tries before giving up. You can adjust this with the retry=xx option. You can get it to print more with verb=7.<br>
<br>
If you send me a pm with your email address, I can email you a tarball with (incomplete) documentation on all the new boot options.

I'm guessing that whatever CDROM driver used in the booter is not in the file it tries to boot. Y'all fill in the proper terms, if you like.<br>

Please don't take those warnings very seriously. It will probably flag many valid kernel boot parameters. I created the list of parameters that don't get flagged. I'm sure there are many gaps in that list. I will add"nodma" to our list so it doesn't get flagged in the future.<br>
<br>
The boot messages are generated by a script which is the first thing that runs when you boot a LiveCD/USB. It is totally independent from the kernel. My ignorance of kernel boot parameters should not be underestimated.</div>

<div class="content">Congrats on getting Mepis to boot.<br>
<br>
I have a couple of ideas for you to try using the test LiveCD you made recently. To be honest, I'm using you as a guinea pig. The problem you are up against is that we are unable to read the /antiX/linuxfs file from the cdrom drive. This file contains an entire Linux filesystem in a compressed form. One solution would be to copy this file to the internal hard drive and then use boot parameters to instruct antiX to use that file.<br>
<br>
If you can boot one of your laptops in Windows, then you should be able to mount (or whatever they call it in Windows) the test antiX LiveCD. Make a C:\antiX\ directory and copy \antiX\linuxfs from the cdrom to the C:\antiX\ directory (I'm sorry if I got the Windows lingo wrong).<br>
<br>
The next step is to get antiX to look for the linuxfs file on your hard-drive. Unfortunately there is no option on the LiveCD to <em>not</em> look for the LiveCD. I will get this fixed before the release. You can override where we look for the linuxfs file by using the"bdev=xxx" boot parameter. I would suggest trying"bdev=hda1" which is the first partition on the first hard drive. <br>
<br>
If you can't boot into Windows, then you might be able to use the Mepis that does boot to do this but that would involve making a custom LiveDVD that is a copy of the Mepis LiveCD with the linuxfs file added to it. This is probably too complicated for now although you should be able to use Mepis to find out which device your internal hard drive shows up as. From the command line:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>$ ls /dev/hd* /dev/sd*</code></pre></div>
should show you all the internal drives and their partitions. You would have to mount them to see how big each one is. You should also try running the"blkid" command. It will show you all the devices we are interested in and only the devices we are interested in.<br>
<br>
You could also use a breakpoint with the test antiX LiveCD to see what devices are available. You can set a breakpoint with"bp=N" where N is one or more digits. The first breakpoint is set with"bp=1". This should get you to a limited shell early in the boot process. From this shell, you can find all your block devices (cdrom, hard drives, usb drives, etc) with these two commands:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>antiX&gt; mdev -s
antiX&gt; blkid</code></pre></div> The prompt you will see should be"antiX&gt;". If something shows up on that list that does not start with /dev/sd* or /dev/hd* then this may well be your cdrom device. You can simply try booting with"bdev=xxx" where xxx is device that was listed. For example you might use"bdev=cdrom" or"bdev=/dev/cdrom" (they both do the same thing) if the device /dev/cdrom was listed. Otherwise, use this list to see which device your internal hard drive shows up as. <br>
<br>
You can even try to mount your internal drive. Let's say /dev/hda1 shows up on the list. Then use these commands to mount it:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>antiX&gt; mkdir -p /mnt/windows
antiX&gt; mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows
antiX&gt; ls /mnt/windows</code></pre></div>If that mount command fails, you could also try:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>antiX&gt; mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows
antiX&gt; mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows</code></pre></div>
If you do mount your internal drive, it would be best to unmount it before moving on:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>antiX&gt; umount /mnt/windows</code></pre></div>(Note: no"n" in umount).<br>
<br>
Use the"exit" command to continue booting.<br>
<br>
I don't know if I have been any help to you but I can tell you for sure that you've been a big help to me in making the next release more friendly for people in your situation. Thank you.</div>

After setting"bp=1" on the new antiX-test CD,<br>
The only response to"blkid" is:<br>
/dev/ram: LABEL ="initrd....."<br>
<br>
I'll see if the old MEPIS CD accepts bp's.<br>
<br>
The hard drive on the target laptop has Ubuntu 6.06 installed and running well.</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>mckemie wrote:</cite>No microsoft software here. Never has been. Never will be.</div></blockquote>Good. Let's see if we can get the recent Linux kernels working then.<br>

Maybe it is just like you said a while ago and we need a kernel driver. We'd have to modify an iso to include the driver but that's not a big deal once we know which one(s) is/are needed. <br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The hard drive on the target laptop has Ubuntu 6.06 installed and running well.</div></blockquote>Great! Can you get information from the laptop electronically? Perhaps with email? If you can then I'd like to see the output of"lsmod" and especially the output of"lspci -vmmk". This should tell me which kernel modules (drivers) need to get added to the iso. If you don't have net access then maybe you could take a digital picture of the screen with the output of"lspci -vmmk | grep ^Driver".</div>
