<div class="content">I thought that version control is absolutely essential for software development. That's why I've implemented it in Swift Linux. So I was surprised to learn that antiX Linux isn't currently using it.<br>
<br>
How can antiX Linux development proceed smoothly without version control? I'm trying to learn about the development process of various distros. Swift Linux is the first distro I've ever worked on. I'm pretty sure that well-established distros (antiX, MEPIS, Mint, etc.) have much better development processes than I have. I'm sure there are also some differences as well, but I'll figure out which distros to follow in those respects later.</div>

<div class="content">Simply because it wasn't needed. Up until antiX-M8.5, there were no 'antiX apps' as such, just some scripts. Everything was upstream either from Debian, MEPIS, sidux/aptosid or some deb files from other sources eg gogglesmm.<br>
<br>
There is no 'official' development team for better or worse, though I do consider those who have contributed to antiX as part of the 'development team', just that it is done very informally and with no strings attached. Dave's scripts, lagopus's antix2usb script, Burt Holland's cli-installer script, BitJam's linuxrc script are all part of development and they have undergone a lot of changes. Just that this was done informally rather than through version control through git for example.<br>
<br>
Now that antiX has more of its own apps, maybe we'll set up some version control. I had set up git, but never bothered with it. antiX is also on sourceforge, so maybe we can do it through there.<br>
