<div class="content">Hi there,<br>
Longtime fan of AntiX. It has worked great on some older hardware I have had. Lately, I have been interested in getting it to work on a Macbook (bought in 2008), but I am having issues booting into the Live USB. I am currently trying it with antiX-15-V_x64-full.iso.<br>
<br>
The current situation is that the Macbook already has OSX wiped out and is single booting into Mint 17.3 Xfce edition. I just installed Mint this week, but before I did it (when OSX was still on the machine), I was able to boot into Live USB's of different distros (including Mint, Debian, and another Debian-based one called Semplice). I did not try AntiX at the time.<br>
<br>
Now that OSX is wiped and Mint is on it, I actually can no longer boot into any Live USB's (including AntiX), EXCEPT for the Linux Mint one. That is, I can boot into the Mint installed OS as well as the Live USB (the same one I used to install).<br>
<br>
Before, when OSX was still on there, I would hold the alt/option key and it would show multiple"drives". One mysteriously called Windows (I never had Windows on here, I think it just calls it that), and 2 called EFI. Clicking either of the EFI ones would put me into the USB live session. <br>
<br>
Now that OSX is wiped out, the EFI drives no longer show, and clicking the only available"Windows" drive leads me to a black screen that states: Missing Operating System. This happens to the regular Debian live install as well as Semplice and AntiX, despite the former two booting into the Live USB no problem when OSX was still on there. Mint, on the other hand, has the same behavior before as it does now... I can boot into the Live USB no problem. <br>
<br>
I was wondering if anyone has any insight into what has changed before and after OSX was wiped that might lead to MOST Live USB's failing to be recognized, despite being recognized before? I have put an inquiry into the Mint boards to get some insight into what makes their .iso image special. <br>
<br>
Anyway, any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I would love to end up with AntiX on this Macbook if I can just get past this issue. Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">If you have installed GRUB2, you need to do the update-grub in the distribution that generated it.<br>
<br>
Depending on the type of Mac Raises the problem to boot the antiX.<br>
In such a case it might be willing to resolve the rEFInd:<br>

<div class="content">Thanks for the responses guys! I feel like an idiot. I spent an entire day researching the issue when I read someone mention that most distros need to be burned onto a CD to work on a Macbook. So I did and I now have AntiX installed! It is working great. I have not taken care of booting details yet so I can only get into AntiX if I hold the option key down and then select it, but that is fine for now. I will research a bit more into Refind and Refit or other options.</div>
