Glad you made it! It was BSD that was in a dispute, and the dispute was between AT&amp;T and the University of California at Berkeley over the use of source code. AT&amp;T opened licensing issues with the Berkeley campus over software that they were using and modifying in their Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD) of Unix (not the"branded" UNIX label we have now).<br>
<br>
Because there was so much concern, BSD, BSDi and a few other BSD-based distributions, except those that also had full UNIX System V licenses, pretty much came to a halt or at least suspended work. FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD arose from those disputes, completely rewriting their systems, so technically they are NOT UNIX or Unix, only Unix-like and BSD-like.<br>
<br>
Linux emerged around the same time, but for different reasons. Linus Torvalds didn't like Microsoft software, was studying operating systems in his collegeate activities, and spent at least $5000 on computer hardware so he really could not afford another $2000-$5000 for a full Unix distribution or source code, so he grabbed Minux instead, and used it as the basis of creating his own operating system. He had no idea that it would"catch on" so quickly; he simply shared a few tidbits about it on a computer OS forum (I think it may have been comp.os.minix).<br>
<br>
The rest is history. FreeBSD and the others did eventually get going but they always had more of a server emphasis. Linux has developed for servers, but also for desktops, appliances, and the kernel is used in phones and tablets as well.<br>

These two links ought to fill in any details and correct any mistakes or omissions in my note. Most of my statements should be correct because I've read Torvald's book,"Just For Fun" in the past, and I've also read about the litigation over the years - technically it was between USL (as opposed to the original AT&amp;T name) and the Univ of Cal at Berkeley. Hopefully the inclusion of the links will clarify any technical discrepancies what I've written from memory.</div>

<div class="content">About 2 years ago I was giving a try to this Venezuelan Distro"Venenux" (the second Venezuelan attempt after the official"Canaima" Distribution) and surprisingly enough it was buggy to the point that even its main menu didn't respond to a basic command as log off.<br>
<br>
It was a Debian with LXDE-RazorQT desktop, and the reason of the buggy behaviour apparently was this:<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Debian Bug report logs - #669646<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">lxpolkit conflict with other polkit daemons</span><br>
<br>
Reported by: PICCORO McKAY<br>
<br>
Subject: lxpolkit conflict with other polkit daemons, bug 677171 in bugzilla<br>
Package: lxpolkit<br>
Version: 0.1.0-1<br>
Justification: renders package unusable<br>
Severity: grave<br>
<br>
During login (lxde) this error pops up:<br>
<br>
GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1.Error.Failed: An authentication agent<br>
already exists for the given subject<br>
<br>
and then lxpolkit its unusable! due some other ahve in running ... specialy<br>
gnome-polkit!! grrrrr<br>
<br>
A rasonable solution is so go into"Preferences-&gt;Desktop<br>
Session Settings" and un-check"PolicyKit Authentication Agent" as LXDE runs<br>
it's own LXPolKit Authentication Agent, but now solve due message still<br>
show!<br>
This its due network-manager-gnome need explicy the gnome-polkit agent, so<br>
this could be a solution if n-m applet not depends too many stupid gnome parts..<br>
but..<br>
I understand the"gnome" name in the packages involucrated, but for<br>
end-users theres no others solutions in debian for manage USB conection, gnome-ppp<br>
its no good for manage USB conections due have to restart in many times if<br>
conection lost...<br>
<br>
GNOME maintainers refused to reorganized the agent, instead they suggested<br>
to hardcode the agent somewhere. This was part of the"PolkitAgentReorg"<br>
featurethat never happened.    </div></blockquote>
The Venenux Distro is now abandoned, acording to DistroWatch. <br>
<br>
I thought that the making of a light Distro was too hard until I learnt how"Anticapitalist" turns them in some Piece of works! Now the fear is over...</div>

<div class="content">AntiX, at least for me, has been the way best small to medium sized distribution for many years, nearly a decade, in fact.<br>
<br>
The MX-14 variation is somewhat larger, but still very reasonable as a stable desktop system.<br>
<br>
You can find lighter live distributions, such as Puppy, from which this project has certainly borrowed and reused ideas from time to time.<br>
<br>
Years ago we also borrowed and reused IceWM configuration ideas from Absolute Linux, but I think that our collection of tools, capabilities, and balance between modest size, reasonable capabilities, and ease of use provide an excellent balance.<br>
<br>
Still, the best feature of all is the flexibility in which you can create whatever meets your specific needs.</div>

<div class="content">It was a screenshot in a magazine that first grabbed my attention. Esthetics is important to me, and while I was perfectly happy with the functionality of Ubuntu, each new iteration seemed uglier than the previous one. And I just couldn't get used to Unity. But I love the minimalist and lightweight design of the fluxbox window manager, and it looks great too.<br>
<br>
I've been experimenting with Antix for a year or so, as a live system, to take with me everywhere, and on a very old laptop that has gotten a second life thanks to Antix. Now I decided to give it a try on my main system. There are a few minor inconveniences that I hope to polish away, but overall I'm very happy with the combination spacefm/fluxbox.</div>

<div class="content">I had used antiX 8.5 back in the day. I've been a Linux user (though not a power user by any stretch of the imagination) full-time at home since around 2001 or maybe even 1999. In that time, I've used Mandrake 8.0 (my first distro), Libranet, Feather, Xandros, Mint, Peppermint, openSuSE, Manjaro, and probably some others I can't remember (plus a number that I simply ran live to get a taste of). <br>
<br>
After running into some quirky things with my Manjaro installation, I decided to give Peppermint 6 and antiX-15 a try. Installing Peppermint 6 was a disaster. I could not boot into nor figure out how to run it without running from the Live USB. So I decided to give antiX-15 a spin. Installed, booted, set up sound, network, and printer, and I was off to the races.</div>

<div class="content">Hello everybody!<br>
I have a year or so of Linux experience, started with Manjaro Xfce Netbook Edition on my wife's EeePC netbook (replced Windows XP). Then Manjaro and a short stop at openSuSe (because of btrfs install). Half a year ago I purchased less than 10 Euros a new thin client PC with 1GHz Via Eden CPU, and upt to 4GB RAM (but with no proper SATA power cable interface) and a VX800 chpset with Via Chrome9 GPU. But no Linux USB would start on it, always got black screen or noisy colourful lines. As a Linux newbie it was hard to find out, how to use cheatcodes like xforcevesa on Ubuntu based distros. Debian based distros didn't accept xforcevesa - only recently I found out that some of them need just vga=ask or s.th. similar to boot into a screen with perfect resolution, what others cannot by booting into vesa session. Manjaro boots from stick too on this VX800 chipset, but it cannot run the openchrome driver after install. My first successful install was LXLE, but I simply prefer Xfce to LXDE, although I lerned to tweak LXDE to my liking there. But then I messed up s.th. with the file system (plugged the SATA cable too early when switching on reboot to a test install on a CF card) and had to reinstall. I got a tip to install Debian then and tried several live versions. With more Linux experience now I got them booting. AntiX MC-14 was the only one to work with WLAN card out of the box and it offered Xfce 4.12 which I learned to like on Manjaro. Installation was tricky, because you cannot install on btrfs subvolumes which I'm a great fan of. But after three atempts I managed to move the files from / to the @ and @home subvolumes and update GRUB properly so it boots. The Siduction user here was of great help:

Now I am a happy full time user of MX-14 and do not regret all the efforts, because I run a fast, beautiful OS on a noiseless machine (the fan runs with minimal speed without noise). And I'm learning a different Linux approach - the Debian way.<br>
Of course I'm looking forward to get to know a new forum community, too!<br>
Have a nice time!</div>

<div class="content">Having done a Solaris Unix course back in about 1998, I tried some distros received with magazines, but due to lots of issues didn't take converting to Linux very seriously. When my then laptop running W98 became unusable in 2006, I decided that I wanted to use Linux as much as possible. I have been predominantly Linux since then. I tried several distros for the first few months, then tried Linux Mint 'Barbara' from early 2007 for a couple of years. <br>
Then in early 2009 the distro hopping bug struck again and I installed PCLinuxOS. It is still the main install on my current laptop. Around the same time I I tried my first Puppy version 4.2 and still regularly use Puppy derivatives. I always have several Puppy derivatives as frugal installs on hard drives and also a Flash drive which has several different derivatives as well. I have been using DebianDog Jessie regularly recently.<br>
<br>
I saw the antix 15 release announcement recently, so having an understanding of frugal installs and seeing fluxbox was an one of included DE's thought it would be a good distro to try out. As i set up all my frugal installs manually, took a while to figure out how to get the persistence working correctly. All is working well at the moment.</div>

Hi and welcome! I've tried wattOS 8 two days ago and liked its visual design and small ISO size. I didn't like the lack of a root user. If you are interested you can take a look at my recent thread in Hardware section: mx-14-is-the-only-current-distro-to-run-nicely-on-via-vx800-t5917.html<br>
Have fun on the forum and post s.th., it need some action here! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
