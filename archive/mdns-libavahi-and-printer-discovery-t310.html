<div class="content">For various reasons, I want to setup some kind of printer discovery - at least to figure out the printer's IP address. (As opposed asking the router's DHCP server what address it assigned - which is not possible on somebody else's LAN)<br>
<br>
I see that AntiX has libavahi-client3 installed by default, so I figured the printer tool would be able to find the printer given any of several host names the printer claims: npiff843f.local, deskjet.local, hp5850.local, 5850.local, hp5800.local, 5800.local and several others I could think of. Did not work.<br>
<br>
I found and installed mdns-scan. It found the printer and all the computers - except the AntiX system.<br>
<br>
I tried the funny names (like [0c:09:a4:86:54:ca]._printer._tcp.local) that mdns-scan listed. Still did not work.<br>
<br>
I tried all these various names in FireFox (the printer has a built in http server), also did not work.<br>
<br>
I then found and installed libnss-mdns. After the install was complete, the antiX computer started being listed by mdns-scan. The only other difference I could see is that the installation updated the /etc/nsswitch.conf file.<br>
<br>
Even after rebooting at various points after installing things, nothing could find the printer (except via IP address).<br>
<br>
So far, nothing I've found by googling has suggested anything that I haven't already done (or was done automatically).<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Have you tried"avahi-discover". It claims this functionality.<br>

<div class="content">avahi-discovery just seems to be a better version of mdns-scan.<br>
<br>
The one I thought would work for sure is libnss-mdns, but still no luck.</div>

<div class="content">Strangely, the mDNS stuff started fully working with no further reboots - not that they were helping.<br>
<br>
What happened, I went to a book clucb meeting, taking my laptop (the antiX system). While I was there, I tried fetching a drawing a friend did, from his laptop, without first getting his current IP. It just worked.<br>
<br>
So, when I went home, I found it all working there, too.<br>
<br>
No reboots. Just unplugged form my own LAN, plugged into the host's LAN, and it worked. Then, vice-versa, returning home. (I live close enough to the host's home, I didn't bother to shutdown. (and used the power adaptor while I was there)<br>
<br>
I guess I was right about libnss-mdns (and/or any of the other packages it pulled in when I installed it) being the key.</div>
