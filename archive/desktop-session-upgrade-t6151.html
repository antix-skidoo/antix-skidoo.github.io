<div class="content">You should answer Y (yes) to accepting the maintainers version.<br>
If you choose no, or have already chosen no, then you might need to edit a file to stop a yad dialog at desktop session from not closing.<br>
<br>
If so do this:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Disable it in control centre/session/global-desktop-session/desktop-session.conf

Change line 37"Notification Dialog". dialog to read false

You might need to logout and in again
</code></pre></div>
Do the same if you have a desktop-session.conf in your home/username/.desktop-session directory.<br>

<div class="content">Thanks anti, this was annoying me! It happened on both desktops, however, the one cured itself after several reboots. Oddly, my laptop was fine, even though I accepted all the defaults in all instances.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
<br>
EDIT: I have now had to apply the fix to all of my computers, as it has appeared on the laptop and the other desktop. Weird how it apparently happens randomly on reboots. All fine now though.</div>

So thanks! Everything (seemingly) was suddenly updated, somehow it still fit on disk! Incroyable! Kind of glad I'm skipping the systemd.<br>
Still...what's the low-impact low-power upgrade that stays in the AntiX target arch? Intel sticks?<br>
<br>
Now, the monitor wasn't going to sleep and xscreensaver isn't doing the ACPI events, but I haven't replicated that over reboots and there's no red flag in dmesg, so maybe that's not a real thing yet. Let drop what one should be feeding -v6 and -debug if there's a fake dbus channel to sometimes hustle along?<br>
edit: Maybe restarted Firefox and it fixed itself?! Quick, have the AntiX marketing department and policy lobby work up these self-healing properties!</div>
