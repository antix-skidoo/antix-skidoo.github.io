<div class="content">hi AntiX folks! new user here.<br>
<br>
plz forgive me if I rave/rant on about this distro. I will try to be concise. It is not my intention to offend anyone involved with this project as it grows. It is GOOD to be here, finally.<br>
<br>
Although I am not a newb to linux, I am also no expert but have had my share of grief and managed to find solutions to successfully install/run linux' on many hardware configurations. Like many of you, we've tried numerous distros, blown them off, made coasters of .ISOs, re-installed, tried again and again, dealt with bugs, worked 'em out &amp; been satisfied with MANY over the years (Redhat, fedora, suse, mandrake, deb, gentoo, slack, knoppix, ubuntu, etc. etc .. to name a few and also many of their subsidiaries) Anyway... <br>
<br>
I recently came across AntiX while I was looking for a"lightweight" distro to run on an old laptop. Although many distros sport"lightweight for older computers" I need you guys to know something.<br>
<br>
When you find a distro running a beautiful WM, that boots from a live CD in under 5 minutes, installs to hard disk 20 minutes later, has recognized your pcmcia ethernet, and you are browsing the web to find out just how you can tweak/customize/better this OS for YOUR needs you realize instantly that"you really got sumpin' here... FINALLY!"<br>
<br>
Now. This may not impress some of you but I am not BSing you when I tell you, that AFTER all of that!... and just simply running"apt-get update" and"apt-get dist-upgrade"... (of course that took some time but whatever), check this folks... I have a Toshiba 4060XCDT laptop (PII 333Mhz/192MB RAM) booting to the login screen in like 1m30s and to the desktop with taskbar/functionality AND HARD DRIVE"ACTIVITY=ZERO" in approx. 1m50s!!<br>
<br>
Of course this is from a cold boot, with me hitting [Return] as soon as I seen Grub, and, typing my login/pw as fast as I could just so I could time it haha.... OMG! The results are in...<br>
<br>
AntiX ROCKS! Now... I am off to see if I can get Enlightenment DR17 installed/working along with a few other customizations and I KNOW if I have probs, no worries, it's Deb. It WILL work OR I'll be able to recover it and try again.<br>
<br>
Thanks you guys! This OS truly is a gem! Really! There IS hope for ppl who want to resurrect old machines and see them run beautifully like the day they brought em home from the store! Albeit without the OS they were shipped with that absolutely sucks!<br>
<br>
(sorry for the long post...had to give praise where it's due!) Go MEPIS/AntiX!<br>
Amazing. /hats off to ya!<br>

I only read raves, no rants <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
Before any rant, post here in the forum and help antiX get better.<br>
<br>
I imagine it must be very satisfying to run such a complete and well functioning o.s. in an 'old', while still functioning machine.</div>
