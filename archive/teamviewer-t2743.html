<div class="content">I just installed teamviewer on my Mepis Desktop and on my 8.5 antiX install on my laptop, I am really impressed with this, after starting both sessions, from my desktop I could run any program remotely on the laptop, just a test case as my son is down-syndrome and lives in Colorado and needs help with his computer from time to time, this will be ideal for me to remotely update and troubleshoot his computer providing that it works from my linux box to his window's box.<br>
My next test is to install it on a laptop with Win Vista and see how it performs. Don't know if anyone here has experience with this but your input would be appreciated.<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.teamviewer.com/download/index.aspx?os=linux"<br>linktext was:"http://www.teamviewer.com/download/index.aspx?os=linux"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
edit: The only glitch I had installing in antiX 8.5, I got an error message about the color depth not being set to 24bpp so it would not run, went to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and changed from 16 to 24 and that fixed the issue.<br>

<div class="content">Hello ohh,<br>
Just came across this post and I did try teamviewer awhile back. I think it was around 11/5/2010. I burned a copy of Fedora 14 and noticed that teamviewer was included. I too was impressed. I don't recall getting the same error as you though. I was able to control my daughter's XP laptop from my antiX 8.5. desktop. Your post inspired me to have another go at it. Definitely a worth"playing" with.<br>
<br>
Have you continued with your experimentation? Have any more useful tips? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>

<div class="content">The Linux version can interact with a windows host and visa-versa, but there is one caveat, the versions running on both systems must be"equivalents" or the remote connection will fail. This is I believe, a design feature, not a so-called fault as the version matching is required for any connection between 2 machines, regardless of what OS they use. Another caveat is the Linux version runs atop of a modified wine 1.2, so cetain features may or may not work and others may work inconsistently.<br>
<br>
I tried it today, connecting both ways, allowing an Ubuntu guest to access my Mepis laptop as my Brother did a server build on my laptop using my VirtualBox up until the time he could ssh straight into the virtual server without having to use third party proprietary products. He had endless troubles with copy and paste not working consistently, as well as trying to send key combinations to the host machine whilst operating as guest. (the windows to windows versions do not have this issue) In short, it works, to a degree, but the current versions available from their site are not mutually compliant when using a mixed OS connection that includes Linux and Windows, though I'd expect them to have that corrected fairly quickly. I had to use Teamviewer to assist 2 windows users today and I was unable to use my Linux version as I had done up till last week, I had to fire up my VirtualBox XP guest, install the windows version and operate through that, all because despite having the latest of each on each OS, they still claimed mine was not a late enough version.<br>
