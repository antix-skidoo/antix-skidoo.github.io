<div class="content"><strong>acpid</strong> - Modern computers support the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)<br>
to allow intelligent power management on your system and to query battery and<br>
configuration status.<br>
<br>
ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for delivering<br>
ACPI events. It listens on a file (/proc/acpi/event) and when an event<br>
occurs, executes programs to handle the event. The programs it executes<br>
are configured through a set of configuration files, which can be<br>
dropped into place by packages or by the admin.<br>
<br>
<strong>alsa-utils</strong> - This package contains utilities for configuring and using ALSA, including:<br>
o amixer: command line mixer<br>
o alsamixer: curses mixer<br>
o amidi: read from and write to ALSA RawMIDI ports<br>
o aplay, arecord: command line playback and recording<br>
o aplaymidi, arecordmidi: command line MIDI playback and recording<br>
o aconnect, aseqnet, aseqdump: command line MIDI sequencer control<br>
<br>
ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.<br>
<br>
<strong>atd</strong> -<br>
<br>
<strong>aumix</strong>- aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound<br>
card. It runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command<br>
line (non-interactively). It can read default settings from a file, and it<br>
can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and<br>
boot.<br>
<br>
Additionally this version can be run as a GTK+ app, i.e. with a graphical<br>
interface. It can also still run in text-only mode, though.<br>
<br>
<strong>bootlogs</strong> -<br>
<br>
<strong>cpufrequtils</strong> - This package contains two utilities for inspecting and setting the<br>
cpu frequency through both the sysfs and procfs CPUFreq kernel<br>
interfaces.<br>
<br>
By default it also enable CPUFreq at boot time if the correct cpu<br>
driver is found.<br>
<br>
<strong>cron</strong> - The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at<br>
particular times (for example, every minute, day, week or month), as<br>
specific in the in a crontab. By default, users may also create<br>
crontabs of their own so that processes are run on their behalf.<br>
<br>
Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on<br>
their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to<br>
particular users.<br>
<br>
Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator<br>
(or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system<br>
as well so that you can receive these messages.<br>
<br>
<strong>cryptdisks</strong> - <br>
<br>
<strong>cups</strong> - The Common UNIX Printing System (or CUPS(tm)) is a printing system and<br>
general replacement for lpd and the like. It supports the Internet<br>
Printing Protocol (IPP), and has its own filtering driver model for<br>
handling various document types.<br>
<br>
This package provides the CUPS scheduler/daemon and related files.<br>
<br>
<strong>dbus</strong> - D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.<br>
Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in<br>
terms of complexity.<br>
<br>
D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus<br>
decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be<br>
low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using<br>
XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but<br>
it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.<br>
<br>
It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.<br>
<br>
This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.<br>
<br>
<strong>discover</strong> (not installed)- Discover is a hardware identification system based on the libdiscover2<br>
library. Discover provides a flexible interface that programs can<br>
use to report a wide range of information about the hardware that is<br>
installed on a Linux system. In addition to reporting information,<br>
Discover includes support for doing hardware detection at boot time.<br>
<br>
<strong>ejectcd</strong> - <br>
<br>
<strong>exim4</strong> - Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4 is the metapackage depending<br>
on the essential components for a basic exim4 installation.<br>
<br>
The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://pkg-exim4.alioth.debian.org/"<br>linktext was:"http://pkg-exim4.alioth.debian.org/"<br>====================================<br>
" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false. There is also a Debian-specific<br>
FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are<br>
configured can be found in<br>
/usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains<br>
information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The<br>
very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in<br>
/usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven<br>
configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure<br>
exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,<br>

<br>
<strong>firehol</strong> - Generates generic firewalls with an extremely simple but powerful<br>
configuration language, enabling you to design any kind of local<br>
or routing stateful packet filtering firewall with ease.<br>
<br>
Firehol does not support ipv6.<br>
<br>
<strong>fuse</strong> - userspace filesystem framework for Linux<br>
<br>
<strong>gpm</strong> - This package provides a daemon that captures mouse events when the system<br>
console is active, and delivers events to applications through a library.<br>
<br>
By default, the daemon provides a 'selection' mode, so that<br>
cut-and-paste with the mouse works on the console just as it does<br>
under X.<br>
<br>
<strong>hal</strong> - HAL provides an abstract view on hardware.<br>
<br>
This abstraction layer is simply an interface that makes it possible to<br>
add support for new devices and new ways of connecting devices to the<br>
computer, without modifying every application that uses the device.<br>
It maintains a list of devices that currently exist, and can provide<br>
information about those upon request.<br>
<br>
<strong>hdparm</strong> - Get/set device parameters for Linux SATA/IDE drives.<br>
Primary use is for enabling irq-unmasking and IDE multiplemode.<br>
<br>
<strong>ifplugd</strong> - ifplugd is a daemon which will automatically configure your ethernet device<br>
when a cable is plugged in and automatically de-configure it if the cable is<br>
pulled out. This is useful on laptops with onboard network adapters, since it<br>
will only configure the interface when a cable is really connected. Features<br>
include:<br>
<br>
* syslog support<br>
* Multiple ethernet interface support<br>
* Uses Debian's native ifup/ifdown programs<br>
* Small executable size and memory footprint<br>
* Option to beep when the cable is unplugged or plugged<br>
* Option to beep when the interface configuration succeeds or fails<br>
* Can be configured to ignore short unplugged or plugged periods<br>
* Configure WLAN devices (on detecting a successful association to an AP)<br>
<br>
<strong>irda-utils</strong> - This package contains userspace utilities to manage and handle infrared<br>
devices. It includes irattach, findchip, irdadump, irdaping and irpsion5.<br>
OBEX tools are removed since 0.9.5. If you need to use IrOBEX,<br>
use openobex-apps package.<br>
<br>
<strong>kbd</strong> - This package allows you to set up the Linux console, change the font,<br>
resize text mode virtual consoles and remap the keyboard.<br>
<br>
You will probably want to install a set of data files, such as the one<br>
in the “console-data” package.<br>
<br>
<strong>lighttpd</strong> - lighttpd is a small webserver and fast webserver developed with<br>
security in mind and a lot of features.<br>
It has support for<br>
* CGI, FastCGI and SSI<br>
* virtual hosts<br>
* URL rewriting<br>
* authentication (plain files, htpasswd, ldap)<br>
* transparent content compression<br>
* conditional configuration<br>
and configuration is straight-forward and easy.<br>
<br>
<strong>loadcpufreq</strong> - <br>
<br>
<strong>mepis-network.sh</strong> - Simple network configuration for SimplyMEPIS. Community members Marcos and Jerry donated major updates and enhancements for version 8.0. Many thanks!<br>
<br>
<strong>module-init-tools</strong> - This package contains a set of programs for loading, inserting, and<br>
removing kernel modules for Linux.<br>
<br>
<strong>planb_rc-5.sh/planb_rc-S.sh</strong> - <br>
<br>
<strong>policykit</strong> - PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy<br>
that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.<br>
<br>
It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to<br>
granting access to privileged operations (like calling the HAL Mount() method)<br>
for unprivileged (desktop) applications.<br>
<br>
<strong>powersaved</strong> - Provides battery, temperature, ac, cpufreq (SpeedStep, Powernow!)<br>
control and monitoring.<br>
Powersaved is a policy daemon which defines what to do on certain power<br>
management events, like power button presses or ac plug/unplug.<br>
It relies on HAL/pm-utils to do the heavy lifting.<br>
<br>
<strong>pppd-dns</strong> - <br>
<br>
<strong>procps</strong> - These are utilities to browse the /proc filesystem, which is not a real file<br>
system but a way for the kernel to provide information about the status of<br>
entries in its process table. (e.g. running, stopped or"zombie")<br>
Both command line and full screen utilities are provided. Ncurses is needed<br>
for the full screen utilities. More information can be found at procps<br>
website

<br>
This package includes the following utilities: top, uptime, tload,<br>
free, vmstat, watch, skill, pmap, pgrep, slabtop and pwdx.<br>
<br>
<strong>rsync</strong> - rsync is a program that allows files to be copied to and from remote<br>
machines in much the same way as rcp. It has many more options than<br>
rcp, and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to greatly speed up<br>
file transfers when the destination file already exists.<br>
<br>
The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the<br>
differences between two sets of files across the network link.<br>
<br>
This package also includes rsyncd daemon functionality.<br>
<br>
<strong>rsyslog</strong> - Rsyslog is an enhanced syslogd supporting, amongst others:<br>
* reliable syslog over TCP and SSL/TLS<br>
* on-demand disk buffering<br>
* email alerting<br>
* writing to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases (via separate output plugins)<br>
* permitted sender lists<br>
* filtering on any part of the syslog message<br>
* on-the-wire message compression<br>
* fine grained output format control<br>
* backup log destinations<br>
<br>
It is quite compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in<br>
replacement. Its advanced features make it suitable for enterprise-class,<br>
encryption protected syslog relay chains while at the same time being very<br>
easy to setup for the novice user.<br>
<br>
<strong>saned</strong> - SANE stands for"Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application<br>
programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any<br>
raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,<br>
video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is<br>
free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The<br>
current source code is written to support several operating systems,<br>
including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available<br>
under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and<br>
backends are welcome, too, however).<br>
<br>
This package includes the command line frontend scanimage, the saned<br>
server and the sane-find-scanner utility, along with their documentation.<br>
<br>
<strong>slim</strong> - desktop-independent graphical login manager for X11<br>
<br>
SLiM aims to be light and simple, although completely configurable through<br>
themes and an option file. It is particularly suitable for machines that<br>
don't require remote logins.<br>
<br>
<strong>ssh</strong> - Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices.<br>
<br>
<strong>sudo</strong> - Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root<br>
privileges to users and log root activity. The basic philosophy is to give<br>
as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.<br>
<br>
This version is built with minimal shared library dependencies, use the<br>
sudo-ldap package instead if you need LDAP support.<br>
<br>
<strong>svgalib-bin</strong> - svgalib provides graphics capabilities to programs running on the<br>
system console, without going through the X Window System. It uses<br>
direct access to the video hardware to provide low-level access to<br>
the standard VGA and SVGA graphics modes. Only works with some<br>
video hardware; use with caution.<br>
<br>
<strong>transmission-daemon</strong> - Transmission is a simple BitTorrent client. It features a very simple,<br>
intuitive interface (gui and command-line) on top on an efficient,<br>
cross-platform back-end.<br>
<br>
This package contains the transmission-daemon and the associated control<br>
interface, transmission-remote.<br>
<br>
<strong>udev</strong> - udev is a daemon which dynamically creates and removes device nodes from<br>
/dev/, handles hotplug events and loads drivers at boot time. It replaces<br>
the hotplug package and requires a 2.6.18 or newer kernel version.<br>
<br>
<strong>usplash</strong> - Usplash is a userspace application that uses the Linux framebuffer interface<br>
to draw a splash screen at boot. It has a companion utility that is able to<br>
send commands to usplash, allowing information about the bootup sequence to<br>
be displayed in a more attractive way.<br>
<br>
<strong>x11-common</strong> - x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further<br>
installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not<br>
provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities<br>
required to run the X Window System.</div>

<div class="content">I fixed. This list may help people choose the services to start at boot time. I've mostly copied the package info but may eventually simplify just for us to understand what does what. So any contributions to the list is welcome, may be a clarification to the service purpose or even a list with essencial services (must-not disable).</div>
