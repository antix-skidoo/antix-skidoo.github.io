<div class="content">There are a few other Linux distros that try to find some blend between light and functional. DreamLinux and Debris Linux are somewhere in the middle. Neither of them, in my mind, are as refined as antiX is in my mind, but perhaps they could suit your needs. As John mentioned, there are several other distros. Each have their own set of attributes. Maybe one of them will appeal to you more than what has been done with antiX.<br>
<br>
I have to say, though, if you want a system that is as easy or easier to use than antiX, you will probably have to use something that takes up more space. You can go smaller, but then you are likely to give something else up.<br>
<br>
I think, at least for me, that anticapitalista has found an excellent balance. If you can do better for your own personal interests, do let us know what you come up with and what you like about it. I think there is room for more than one Linux distro. As long as we are polite to one another, no reason not to try out many alternatives. Hope you find the one that fits your niche perfectly!</div>

Thanks, impuwat! I appreciate your affirmation. I do hope that our friend is able to find just the right system that meets his specific needs. I am really pleased with the trilogy of systems that I use in SimplyMEPIS (simple and stable), antiX, (fast, flexible, and adaptable), and sidux (cutting edge, yet usable and flexible). <br>
<br>
Each of us have certain needs and expectations in what we use, and I think that it is unreasonable if we expect everyone else to have the same needs and interests as we do. That is what free software is all about - having choices and alternatives. I am really happy and pleased, both with this community and with our SimplyMEPIS brethren. We don't seem bent on having everyone use what we use, though we certainly try to show people why it is that we are so enthusiastic about the systems that we enjoy. At the end of the day, though, it is still about freedom of choice, and I want to make sure that everyone continues to have and enjoy those freedoms!</div>
