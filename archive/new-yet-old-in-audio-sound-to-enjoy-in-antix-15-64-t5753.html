<div class="content">I'll try not to be too long and bore everyone.<br>
What started out a little while ago as an attempt at hunting down a effects processor for virtually any musical instrument for the maemo device line and our community became a mad hunt actually. <br>
It was about a particular thread that bugged me in our forums I'll link to at the end of this write-up. For years this thread bugged me..the posters were asking, hoping and inquiring if a guitar amp program could be run on our device line. <br>
I thought the desire aimed too low in some respects, aimed too high and impractical requirement-wise for virtually any handheld pocket pc, and was all around a terrible idea.<br>
We have musical instrument tuners...we have sheet music programs, music composition...milkytracker ...sunvox..etc..tons of good stuff...and what we can't run natively we have easy debian, arch, kali, and many more distros running on device to pick from.<br>
But what irked me most was ...we had no effects processor for instruments.<br>
For myself...I'm actually a period-piece carver and instrument maker (and player)...since a kid..gramps taught me ...so to cut through college and university edu and finish up quick from memory lane...4ish decades of making cool stuff.. as instruments go I've made many diff. kinds. wire-strung vceltic harps are my personal fav. ...with stereophonic pickups they are wicked plugged into a processor or a laptop and then out to an amp.<br>
So there is a bit of my reasoning...<br>
I wanted a decent hand-held pc effects processor.<br>
little clamp-mount with my n8x0 or n900 built-in mic near one of the sound holes and the ability to tap and change whatever on the fly and record it on device..and route the output from the headphone jack either to headphones for private jamming or output through the headphone port straight to my amps...<br>
Or to a lap via same out put..or bluetooth or wireless...going cordless..and from there going straight to recording and my amps simul. <br>
So yeah... <br>
Made more sense to have an effects processor than just an amp program.<br>
The device line has a decent speakers which are quite loud actually...<br>
So the prob would be feedback from proximity if they had actually gotten an amp program to work...<br>
Anyway..<br>
I'll wrap it up here and not tire your eyes reading much longer.<br>
I finally tracked down the perfect program...minimal requirements...and our maemo devices meet them...it is an older program..so old in fact..only a couple of distros kept the program alive. Most distros to date.. abandoned much of what the program depends on. Openmandriva and Rosa...there were quite a few other distros it worked on ..but the majority of those distros are either gone or they also abandoned the needed dependencies. I managed to finally turn the needed rpms into debs...and low and behold...really the only guys in town it'll work for distro-wise....is youse guyses <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
Fresh from the graveyard...<br>
Newly arisen from the mausoleum ...<br>
I give you GTKgep (GTK guitar effects processor) for antiX 15 64bit...woo-hoo!<br>

Ach..it is a bit of a hack job...another could prolly do it better..<br>
but hey..it works and I love it. can even create effects..<br>
So now more than ever I am lovin' and usin' my antiX.<br>
But ..I do admit I have had little success in cross-compiling it, or"alien-ing" it, or whatever...I'm fairly sharp and all...but I must say such magik isn't my forte..I can't figure how to turn it to an armel for the maemo device line...If you fellas have any ideas ...any help would be greatly appreciated..Give a hand if you could ...<br>
I could really use this on my devices...<br>
<br>
BTW..here is the post with the amd64.debs and instructions...<br>
