<div class="content">OK, here's the scenario..... Got antiX 7.2 installed on my main machine so that i can run, test, &amp; generally play &amp; have fun. But.... my main OS (Linux Mint Daryna) is also on this machine, and as it's the"Main" machine, it gets used by both myself &amp; my partner, who often needs to check emails etc.<br>
<br>
In Mint, i use Thunderbird, and the only way to check them at the moment is to reboot. Does anyone know a way to install Thunderbird in antiX and then use the same data (path, files etc) as the Mint install of Thunderbird? I tried this not so long ago with TintMe and it sort of worked, but there were a few problems i couldn't work out so i left it, but i'd really like to have the option to do this if possible, because it means that i can spend more time in antiX learning about it etc. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Has anyone else done this before?<br>
<br>
Any help or pointers would be much appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">Looks like i've solved it so i thought i'd post it here. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
From antiX start IceDove from the commandline with"thunderbird -profilemanager" .. create a new profile and point to the profilefolder used by Thunderbird on your other Linux system (in my case it's"/media/MintHome/djinn/.mozilla-thunderbird/zthaew43.djinn".<br>
On next startup you'll be sharing your data for both systems.<br>
<br>
Also, you'll have to obviously make sure that the settings are correct in fstab in relation to where your drives are mounted etc. For some reason i couldn't get the standard antiX fstab to mount my partitions properly, so i copied the settings (those that were relevant) from the Mint system and all worked well, after making sure that the folders that they pointed to were also in the correct place (/media).<br>
<br>
And that's about it..... simple, and very effective. Now i can fire up antiX and tinker as much as i like, and still allow people to check emails when they need and send them whenever they want, and all updated so that whenever i boot back into Mint, Thunderbird will be totally up to date! <br>
<br>
Hurrah!!! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
