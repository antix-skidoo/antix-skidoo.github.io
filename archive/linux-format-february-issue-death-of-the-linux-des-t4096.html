From: Linux Format of February 2013<br>
Author: Mayank Sharma<br>
<br>
The death of the desktop?<br>
#########################<br>
A major desktop architect is predicting the end of the Linux desktop. MayankSharma wonders if it's time to give up.<br>
<br>
After a decade of looking for the"year<br>
of the Linux desktop" many Linux<br>
columnists have given up. Some say it<br>
isn't coming, while others claim that Linux<br>
has simply failed on the desktop. If we responded<br>
to everyone who has ever criticised the Linux<br>
desktop, we wouldn't get any work done.<br>
<br>
But Miguel de Icaza isn't just anybody. He's <br>
well respected in the open source community<br>
as the founding developer of one of the two<br>
main Linux desktop environments, the Gnome<br>
desktop. To our utter amazement, even he now<br>
thinks the Linux desktop is dead!<br>
<br>
In a recent post on his personal blog, Icaza<br>
shares his reasons why Linux couldn't pitch<br>
itself as a viable consumer desktop operating<br>
system. His comments are a follow-up to<br>
a Wired article that claimed that Apple OS X<br>
has far outpaced the Linux desktop.<br>
<br>
In the post, titled"What killed the Linux<br>
desktop?" Icaza, from his experience with<br>
Gnome, collates the various reasons for the<br>
Linux desktop's dire predicament. The crux of<br>
his argument is that in their bid for technical<br>
excellence, the Gnome developers tweaked the<br>
software interfaces so often that it became<br>
a nightmare for third-party developers<br>
to support.<br>
<br>
But what started off as a moment of<br>
introspection turned ugly when Icaza blamed<br>
the all-father Linus Torvalds for inadvertently<br>
misleading the larger Linux development<br>
community:"Linus, despite being a low-level<br>
kernel guy, set the tone for our community<br>
years ago, when he dismissed binary<br>
compatibility for device drivers. The kernel<br>
people might have some valid reasons for it,<br>
and might have forced the industry to play by<br>
their rules, but the desktop people did not<br>
have the power that the kernel people did. But<br>
we did keep the attitude."<br>
<br>
He argues that"the problem with Linux on<br>
the desktop is rooted in the developer culture<br>
that was created around it."<br>
<br>
Icaza then writes about how this attitude<br>
affected their development efforts. He explains<br>
that in their bid to eliminate poorly<br>
implemented features, the Gnome developers<br>
mercilessly deprecated APIs for better ones:<br>
"We removed functionality because that<br>
approach is broken,' for degrees of broken from<br>
it is a security hole' all the way to it does not<br>
conform to the new style we are using.'"<br>
<br>
This attribution' obviously didn't go down<br>
well with Torvalds, who dismisses Icaza's claim<br>
that he set the attitude which causes problems<br>
on the desktop.<br>
<br>
In a Google+ thread discussing the post,<br>
Torvalds reflects on his own development style<br>
for the Linux kernel by pointing out that"one of<br>
the core kernel rules has always been that we<br>
never, ever break any external interfaces.<br>
<br>
That rule has been there since day one,<br>
although it's gotten much more explicit only in<br>
the last few years. The fact that we break<br>
internal interfaces that are not visible to<br>
userland is totally irrelevant, and a total<br>
red herring."<br>
<br>
One of his top lieutenants, Theodore Ts'o,<br>
also affirms Torvalds' stance, saying that the<br>
desktop developers have only paid attention to<br>
the kernel developers' attitude towards"internal<br>
interfaces" and have completely ignored their<br>
attitude towards"external interfaces".<br>
<br>
He reiterates Torvalds' position that if<br>
a tweak to the kernel causes an application to<br>
break it should be considered a bug, and the<br>
only fix is to revert the change."Things inside<br>
the kernel can be changed with impunity, but<br>
things which applications depend upon must<br>
not be changed. Unfortunately, the desktop<br>
developers never understood this lesson,"<br>
writes Ts'o.<br>
<br>
Torvalds agrees, adding that"some Gnome<br>
people seem to be in total denial about what<br>
their problem really is. They'll wildly blame<br>
everybody except themselves."<br>
<br>
Incompatible components<br>
#######################<br>
Moving on, the next item on Icaza's list is the<br>
lack of coordination between the various Linux<br>
distros:"The second dimension to the problem<br>
is that no two Linux distributions agreed on<br>
which core components the system should use.<br>
Either they did not agree, the schedule of the<br>
transitions were out of sync, or there were<br>
competing implementations for the same<br>
functionality."<br>
<br>
He illustrates this by again bringing up the<br>
kernel."The efforts to standardise on a kernel<br>
and a set of core libraries were undermined by<br>
the distro of the day that held the position of<br>
power. If you are the top dog, you did not want<br>
to make any concessions that would help other<br>
distributions catch up with you. Being<br>
incompatible became a way of gaining market<br>
share. A strategy that continues to be employed<br>
by the 800 pound gorillas in the Linux world."<br>
<br>
Although there is merit in Icaza's argument,<br>
the kernel developers couldn't help but note the<br>
irony here. Alan Cox, one of the most respected<br>
Linux developers, replies:"That made me<br>
laugh. There was KDE, and Miguel then came<br>
along and created the very confusion he's<br>
ranting about."<br>
<br>
Broken Gnome<br>
############<br>
Cox goes further and blames Gnome for<br>
breaking compatibility on the desktop, saying<br>
Icaza is"dead right about the way the Gnome<br>
people keep breaking their compatibility every<br>
time, not just with the apps but with the UI, with<br>
the config (which is still worse now than in<br>
Gnome 1.x !) and so on. However, it's not an<br>
open source disease, it's certain projects, like<br>
Gnome, disease."<br>
<br>
Cox and another kernel developer, Ingo<br>
Molnar, then point to the kernel's excellent<br>
backward compatibility. Molnar writes that<br>
"the Linux kernel project was always very strict<br>
about keeping its external ABIs, intended ABIs<br>
and even accidental ABIs. This is how it's<br>
possible that Alan Cox's 20-years-old Rogue<br>
game binary, built in 1992, is still compatible<br>
with and working on today's latest Linux kernel<br>
unmodified and will still work 50 years in<br>
the future."<br>
<br>
An ABI (Application Binary Interface) is the<br>
interface between a computer program and the<br>
operating system and defines, among other<br>
things, how an application should make system<br>
calls to the operating system.<br>
<br>
Although both his claims were challenged<br>
and overruled by respected and knowledgeable<br>
members of the open source fraternity, Icaza, in<br>
his original post, concludes that together they<br>
created an ecosystem that didn't appear to be<br>
very welcoming to third-party desktop<br>
app developers.<br>
<br>
"You would try once, do your best effort to<br>
support the top' distro, or if you were feeling<br>
generous the top three' distros. Only to find<br>
out that your software no longer worked six<br>
months later."<br>
<br>
Again, he blames the developer-focused<br>
approach, which he acknowledges helped<br>
pioneer things such as package management.<br>
But in the process, they missed"the bigger<br>
picture" and alienated third-party developers.<br>
<br>
In an update to his post, Icaza clarifies his<br>
position and praises the desktop distros, saying<br>
that"the various Linux on the desktops are the<br>
best they have ever been. Ubuntu and Unity,<br>
Fedora and GnomeShell, RHEL and Gnome 2,<br>
Debian and Xfce, plus the KDE distros," but<br>
adds that this still leaves us with"four major<br>
desktop APIs, and about half-a-dozen popular<br>
and slightly incompatible versions of Linux on<br>
the desktop: each with its own curated OS<br>
subsystems, with different packaging systems,<br>
with different dependencies and slightly<br>
different versions of the core libraries."<br>
<br>
On the Google+ thread, he adds:<br>
"supporting Linux desktop for proprietary<br>
software developers is just too expensive and<br>
the market is both small and deeply<br>
fragmented."<br>
<br>
Icaza's views were endorsed by Christian<br>
Hammond, a VMware developer who works on<br>
the Workstation and Player apps for Linux.<br>
Responding to Icaza's post, Hammond, on<br>
Twitter, writes that at VMware they spent<br>
a considerable amount of time handling the<br>
"compatibility crap".<br>
<br>
Icaza's post, and the subsequent<br>
discussions on various networks, prompted<br>
a much more detailed post from prolific open<br>
source hacker and Linux Format contributor<br>
Michael Meeks, who reasonses that turning<br>
away third-party developers is only one of the<br>
reasons for Linux's poor show on the desktop.<br>
While Meeks mostly agreed with Icaza's<br>
conclusion that"we're still facing a huge uphill<br>
struggle" to make Linux an attractive desktop,<br>
offering, he thinks there are more reasons<br>
behind it than those highlighted by Icaza:<br>
"My punchline is that the Linux desktop faces a<br>
huge and multi-factored ecosystem challenge,<br>
there is no single simple issue to fix."<br>
<br>
Pre-installs are key<br>
####################<br>
In fact, Meeks argues that the"Linux desktop<br>
stack (with existing frozen/back-compatible<br>
API/ABIs) is not profoundly different from other<br>
operating systems" He goes on to add that.<br>
"arguably it is better for ISVs, since we have<br>
access to open the lid on the box and work with<br>
each other."<br>
<br>
Although Meeks thinks that this makes the<br>
Linux desktop preferable to independent<br>
developers, he reasons that we fail to attract<br>
developers because the competition, despite its<br>
lack of technological superiority, has"large,<br>
addressable markets".<br>
<br>
But this seems to be changing as third-party<br>
developers are warming up to the Linux<br>
desktop. Meeks points to video game<br>
development and distribution company<br>
Valve Software, which is working with Intel to<br>
improve open source drivers to better support<br>
its wares.<br>
<br>
However, Meeks believes that even more<br>
important than encouraging app developers is<br>
attracting OEMs to ship computers with Linux<br>
pre-installed.<br>
<br>
Torvalds agrees. In an interaction in June<br>
2012 with students at Aalto University, Finland,<br>
he said that a major reason for the lack of Linux<br>
on the desktop is that the average desktop user<br>
doesn't want to install an operating system:<br>
"You can't get a desktop unless you have preinstalls, <br>
and that hasn't happened."<br>
<br>
Furthermore, he added that the reason<br>
behind Linux's success on the mobile platform<br>
"is not because people are downloading and<br>
installing disc images on their cell phone.<br>
No, it's because it comes on the cell phone<br>
pre-installed."<br>
<br>
If you look hard enough, you'll find some<br>
vendors, including major ones like Dell, that sell<br>
machines with Linux pre-installed. There's also<br>
System76, ZaReason, the Linux Emporium, and<br>
Tiny Green PC, which sells its brand of small,<br>
fanless computers. Some distros, such as<br>
Debian, also maintain a list of OEMs that sell<br>
hardware pre-installed with its distro<br>
(
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.debian.org/distrib/pre-installed"<br>linktext was:"www.debian.org/distrib/pre-installed"<br>====================================<br>
).<br>
There's also a list of Linux-friendly hardware<br>
vendors at 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.linuxpreloaded.com"<br>linktext was:"www.linuxpreloaded.com"<br>====================================<br>
.<br>
<br>
But since the OEMs don't need to dig in to<br>
their wallets to ship Linux on their hardware,<br>
shouldn't the stores be overflowing with Linux<br>
machines? According to Meeks, obtaining the<br>
OS is just one part of the OS pre-install process.<br>
"One of the major business problems of<br>
hardware enablement is that it takes a constant<br>
investment of real cash to pay excellent<br>
engineers to make (brand new) hardware work<br>
reliably," writes Meeks. What he means by that<br>
is that despite it not costing anything to<br>
download and install Linux, there are additional<br>
costs to get the OS working on specific<br>
hardware configurations.<br>
<br>
Again, one would assume that Linux has an<br>
upper hand here. After all, Meeks says, it has<br>
more drivers working out of the box than any<br>
other OS. But our advantage is negated by the<br>
Windows ecosystem, which distributes this cost<br>
among hardware vendors who write their own<br>
drivers, and by the Mac ecosystem, which ships<br>
a very limited set of hardware.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Meeks points out that"even if<br>
hardware can be perfectly enabled, fully<br>
translated, with accurate manuals, support and<br>
update plans, integrated with OEM's imaging<br>
infrastructure, etc, and at near-zero cost, this is<br>
still too expensive."<br>
<br>
He explains that this is because OEMs who<br>
build Windows machines in fact earn revenue<br>
from co-marketing, advertising cuts, and<br>
bundling antivirus and trial versions of software.<br>
These avenues just don't exist on the Linux<br>
desktop.<br>
<br>
So while Linux might not cost OEMs any<br>
money to download and install, Windows,<br>
despite its licensing cost, in fact brings in<br>
revenue for the OEMs.<br>
<br>
Where's the marketing?<br>
######################<br>
Both Meeks and Torvalds agree that even in<br>
cases when a Linux pre-installed desktop is<br>
available with a vendor, it'll miss the cursory<br>
glance of a buyer because of virtually nonexistent marketing efforts.<br>
The average desktop user barely knows<br>
what Linux is, let alone the different distros<br>
beyond Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora. There has to<br>
be a concerted effort on the part of the desktop<br>
distros to make people aware of the alternatives<br>
at their disposal.<br>
<br>
"It is, of course, possible for an excellent<br>
product to spread virally by word of mouth,<br>
clever volunteer marketing, and more but it is<br>
hard work," writes Meeks.<br>
<br>
That said, word of mouth has got us as<br>
many users as it could, but to break through<br>
the mainstream and seize public<br>
consciousness, we need to exploit mainstream<br>
marketing avenues.<br>
<br>
Meeks believes that"we may well already be<br>
more secure, more manageable, more easy to<br>
upgrade, and lower cost, but unless consumers<br>
know about us with the best will in the world,<br>
they can't choose us."<br>
<br>
And we aren't just talking about throwing<br>
money at flashy advertising on the high street.<br>
Marketing desktop Linux is also about creating<br>
awareness. One way of doing so is by changing<br>
the IT curriculum in schools, which in many<br>
countries is still biased towards specific<br>
applications. So, instead of producing<br>
discerning desktop users, the system keeps<br>
churning out ones who are unaware of the<br>
other alternatives.<br>
<br>
Linux as a framework<br>
####################<br>
Arguably the biggest reason for the laggard<br>
pace of the Linux desktop is that there is no<br>
one' Linux desktop. Beyond Windows and Mac<br>
OS X, there's Ubuntu Linux, Fedora Linux, Linux<br>
Mint and hundreds of other options. The<br>
equation is complicated further by the choice of<br>
desktops and other components that one can<br>
run on top of them. Linux, it seems, has an<br>
identity crisis.<br>
<br>
For a long time, we have relished the<br>
diversity and choice available on the Linux<br>
desktop, and counted it as a strength of the<br>
platform. But it's important to realise that when<br>
it comes to mainstream adoption, the lack of<br>
a unified front is actually a hindrance.<br>
In fact, this is something Torvalds agrees<br>
with, and he says as much in our interview in<br>
LXF163:"Well, yes, some things would be<br>
easier if there was no choice" As he explains in<br>
that interview, Torvalds was never interested in<br>
using the Linux trademark to create a default<br>
Linux environment. Nor was the Linux Standard<br>
Base (LSB).<br>
<br>
But if you look at Android, it uses Linux as<br>
a framework, on top of which it assembles<br>
a standardised set of components that make<br>
up its releases. The purists may cringe all they<br>
want, but Google's strategy seems to have<br>
worked on mobile gadgets, such as<br>
smartphones and tablets.<br>
<br>
Now it seems Canonical is trying to replicate<br>
this arrangement on the desktop and other<br>
devices with Ubuntu. The distro has its own<br>
desktop (Unity), its own app store (Ubuntu<br>
Software Center), its own cloud-based storage<br>
and music service (Ubuntu One), and only<br>
supports its own Ubuntu-branded kernel.<br>
In fact, some of the features for its upcoming<br>
Ubuntu 13.04 release will be developed behind<br>
closed doors and later released as open source,<br>
much like Android releases.<br>
<br>
Traditionalists and geeky Linux users have<br>
bickered about this, but Canonical's strategy<br>
seems to be working. They are the officially<br>
supported distro by almost every third-party<br>
developer porting their wares to Linux, such as<br>
the recently-announced move by Valve<br>
Software, that is porting Steam to Linux.<br>
Another thing that has worked in Ubuntu's<br>
favour is the familiarity of its Unity desktop,<br>
especially to Windows and Mac users. As things<br>
stand, the average desktop user sees Linux as<br>
a replacement for Windows, while the<br>
experienced users crib about its similarities<br>
with proprietary OSes.<br>
<br>
The Enterprise desktop<br>
######################<br>
While the issues for the consumer desktop are<br>
being sorted, Meeks suggests we should focus<br>
our energy on the Enterprise desktop."In my<br>
view, the most hopeful strategy for the Linux<br>
desktop is to make it ideal for an enterprise,<br>
while not crippling it for consumers and very<br>
early adopters," he writes.<br>
<br>
Citing his experience with Novell's<br>
commercial Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop<br>
(SLED), Meeks writes that the current<br>
economics of Linux desktops are more<br>
attractive to business users, who prefer<br>
systems that are secure, and integrate well with<br>
the existing network infrastructure.<br>
He says that enterprises tend to purchase<br>
new PCs in batches, typically prefer lockeddown <br>
environments with a limited number of<br>
apps, and have technically literate support<br>
IT staff.<br>
<br>
To attract the business desktop users,<br>
Meeks advises Linux desktop developers to<br>
spend less time tweaking things such as fancy<br>
desktop effects, which might be fun to work<br>
on but don't add any extra value to the<br>
business desktop.<br>
<br>
"It is perhaps not glorious enterprises care<br>
little for the bling that doesn't have a direct,<br>
inarguable business benefit and bling is fun to<br>
hack on," Meeks writes,"but surely creating real<br>
value, that allows people to work more<br>
efficiently, reliably, and speedily has to be a<br>
satisfying thing to do as well."<br>
<br>
The desktop is evolving<br>
#######################<br>
Despite the dropping sales figures of traditional<br>
PCs, we aren't saying that netbooks,<br>
smartphones or tablets will replace the<br>
traditional desktop. The desktop space is<br>
completely different. For one, it has to support<br>
every piece of hardware. On the other hand, the<br>
mobile gadgets have a fairly limited usage<br>
space. Even though a tablet can have hundreds<br>
of apps, you still don't connect it to a lot of<br>
different devices.<br>
<br>
Rather, what we are getting at is that this<br>
new class of devices will have a major impact<br>
on how we interact with and use technology.<br>
<br>
You can notice the change already. For<br>
example, how many of you still print photos at<br>
home with a photo printer? Chances are that,<br>
like many, you just snap a picture with your<br>
smart phone, upload it to a photo sharing<br>
service such as Flickr, and then select the ones<br>
you want printed and send them to a printer,<br>
who delivers physical copies, all without ever<br>
coming into contact with a traditional desktop.<br>
<br>
People should see a desktop operating<br>
system for what it really is, an application<br>
launcher. That said, an average desktop user's<br>
dependence on a particular app is over-rated.<br>
For example, LibreOffice can satisfy all the word<br>
processing needs of an average desktop user.<br>
Sure, we won't try to push Gimp down the<br>
throats of Photoshop users, but how many<br>
Photoshop users do you know of in real life?<br>
<br>
The problem is a bit more complex on the<br>
commercial deployments, with all sorts of<br>
custom apps, as well as industry-specific apps,<br>
almost all of which are developed exclusively for<br>
the Windows desktop.<br>
<br>
But here, too, many applications have been<br>
pushed on to the cloud and are being served<br>
on a browser. Furthermore, thanks to an<br>
increasing number of establishments<br>
embracing the Bring Your Own Device policy,<br>
and extending it to portable devices, such as<br>
tablets, the Linux desktop has a lot of room<br>
to expand.<br>
<br>
So is the Linux desktop dead? Not by a long<br>
shot. It continues to thrive on the Enterprise<br>
desktop, and with a bit more vendor<br>
involvement could really break through on the<br>
consumer desktop as well. LXF<br>
