<div class="content">Yep, there's still a lot of people still using 32 bit systems, &amp; in the end there will likely be specialised distros built specifically for old machines - but in the meantime, AntiX is here. :)</div>

Hopefully the source code for 32-bit systems will remain available for quite a while.  Many distributions are already dropping 32-bit support, but as long as we have current software updates, antiX should be able to maintain support as long as there is interest and individuals able to build the 32-bit code (implying that 32-bit systems will have to be available.<br>
<br>
That may be difficult to maintain forever, but I'm confident that our current team will do the best they can to support 32-bit antiX users as long as they possibly can.  We definitely have one of the best - if not the #1 best remaining 32-bit distribution available, but we do have to acknowledge the many contributions we've obtained over the years - originally from MEPIS, and of course from Debian, and many tools from other distributions provided by various contributors for over a decade.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah. I read about American commentators with fat wallets say 32 bit cannot be found new anymore. Forgetting that Linux is world wide and not everyone has the dollars for" I3"  CPU's or afford 1 gig video card or 8 gig of ram.<br>

OLPC realized this right off the bat. How many posts Brian do you see on Linuxquestions with some guy or gal in the boondocks of our planet say," I got a old Dell D620, Compaq 1540DM,  or IBM T21, etc.............<br>

Me and a Yahoo Tech from Louisiana kinda had a minor feud going on for new users with low specs. My bias was systemd. His bias was Debian. I saw no reason to install a systemd based distro on antique gear.  He saw no reason to install Debian spinoffs. <br>

Until a decade ago, all I had for equipment was a Dell Dimension 4100 desktop and a Dell Latitude D600 laptop, though I've had various systems (an HP 500 series desktop, IBM Thinkpads on loan, and a few other systems occasionally) that I used over the past twenty years.<br>
<br>
The past few years, I got rid of both of those and have a Lenovo 3000 Model Y410 and a Gateway 2000 PA6A; both of them are now about a decade old.  I added my first personally owned 64-bit system a few years ago, a Dell Inspiron 5558.  Even that is aging, though gracefully.  I'm hoping that we still have 32-bit support for several more years; if so, I'll be able to use the Y410 and PA6A for continued 32-bit distro testing, though I don't use either of them for day-to-day work any more.</div>
