<div class="content">Thanks for welcoming me into the anXti forums. I first tried out antiX about 6 months ago and although installed well, couldn't connect to the internet. I modernized and rebuilt a computer for speed and storage, not a gamer. Redownload and installed antiX fluxbox and found an absolutely sophisticated, stable, and fantastic desktop, plethora of tweaks and themes. I also have #! and VSIDO on my PC, but have found Sid is nothing to shy away from. I like the dark themes, mostly because it is easy on the eyes, and looks awesome. AntiX maybe one the very best Debian distro's in the Linux world. I left Windumb about the same time I rebuilt my computer, I was a XP holdout, naturally I went toward Ubuntu and KDE, only after a very short time realized it was not customizable, nor could you remove a package and not crash your OS. It was bloated to the max. Simplicity, minimal, and have complete access to root, control over packaging, and the OS belongs to the user. That is what I like about AntiX, it is absolute. Spending many hours on this distro, found nothing to say I would change or make better, it is an excellent distro. I salute all those who contributed, in all the many ways, and specificly intellectually. For an individual, or group to tune in and acknowledge what the user would want or need is a task in itself. I like Openbox, appreciate Fluxbox a great deal. Also, I was able to install my own personal conky, reflects heavily my PC and what it is doing, know this was an issue in some of the forms. Thanks anticapitalista! zephyr (anXti/#!/VSIDO)</div>

<div class="content">Howdy and Welcome to the board. Since you built yourself a better wheel, you may want to look at MX-14 (a joint collaboration bet antiX and the MEPIS Community.) It uses a lot of the backbone of antiX and adds special MEPIS touches to it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all for such a warm welcome. I have just installed AntiX 14R and have found a few new changes from the menu, but all seems right on! Looking forward to a 64 bit oS however. I did install Nitrogen to use a wallpaper, seems to work well, did not work in the control centre, but I know there are reasons in an alpha release. There is a plethora of interesting attributes with AntiX, especially fluxbox, and have enjoyed Mepis as well. One aspect I would like to address anticaptialista, is that the fluxbox desktop is the most customizable, and completely navigational to a noob, like myself. I like Linux, and Debian, no Windumb or ubuntu on my machine (coldorb), and I like the Sid repositories, even if I am forced into a reformat. I have Liquorix on all my OS's, works well and solid. Openbox, fluxbox, lxde, are the choices I am compeled to work with. Windows was just an OS, did the job that it was designed to do and control, also provided a host of viruses and an ocean of malware and every type of ware that wasn't good for you or the operating system. A horrific mess. On the other hand, as a noob and not an IT guru, Linux is about the user and holds true to every Linux distro I have tried out. I have tested a couple of hundred disros, all Debian and abandoned Ubuntu early, too unstable. Not an expert, but I feel I have tested enough distro's to say that AntiX-Mephis are"leading the pack" and keep the fangs out. Stay the course, Fluxbox is the cutting edge desktop enviroment, not KDE, nor Gnome. KDE will kill itself with all the unwanted forced software (bloat), uninstall any of it, and it crashes. Not good logic for something that could be great, not going far, for what I see. Don't mean to be critical, just placing emphasis on just how AntiX is probably the best distro in the known distro world, and yea I like #! too. I am an Openbox noob I suppose. I retired last week, at 61 I have a lot of time, want to be constructive, find myself envolved in something creative and benificial. I just download AntiX 14R a2 today, I will freely let you know what I find, both good and bad. Looks great so far. Appreciate the dark themes, easy on the eyes, and looks cool. It is quite evident that there is a passion for perfection, I admire greatly that personal attribute. And THANK YOU. Zephyr-/Altus, Oklahoma/USA</div>

<div class="content">Hey folks, installed and currently using the anXti 14-DR, so far it looks and feels great. The changes are apparent and welcomed. I had to uninstall the last distro 13-anXti fluxbox, but I bought another motherboard which wasn't so EFI, don't use it, but the bios really played a tricks on booting, it would skip over the anXti prompt and what ever reason go to #!. It did not like the bootlaoder or something. But, I installed this anXti 14-DR today and no problems. Boots right to the login, happy! One question, and I messed with the toolbar, noticed I could go down in size in the menu, but how to go up? It installed the toolbar at 80%, and clicked it and it went to 79. What do I do to make it fill the top of the screen where I placed it. Like to make it 100%. It's not tint2, and did prowl around a bit to find a menu for the toolbar. Anybody who could me on this would be appreciated, greatly. Other than that, besides the obvious wallpaper thing, is an excellent distro as it has allows been. Thanks anticapitalista, the anXti folks, and the forum. zephyr</div>

<div class="content">I may have asked about the wallpaper before or maybe read why but could you explain the problem (or link to it) in the new releases bugs thread. That way we can add it to the list and not loose it for updating / fixing</div>
