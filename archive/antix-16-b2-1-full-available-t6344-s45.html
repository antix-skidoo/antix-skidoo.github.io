I have been thinking about the test because I'm not sure the results are valid.<br>
<br>
At the time of your post asking for the test to be run, the system was already booted using the nosavestate boot parameter to prevent the existing stored values being used. When you mentioned that I need not explicitly save the values, and before I shut down the system, I went in search of what was already saved and found it in /live/boot-dev/antiX/state/general/files/ etc/network/interfaces.<br>
<br>
The saved value was identical to the one you requested. It had previously been saved automatically. Presumablby that happened when I had manually set up eth1 via ceni some hours earlier and then rebooted. <span style="color: #BF0000">In every reboot thereafter eth1 never automatically connected despite the saved setting.</span><br>
<br>
Because the value you wanted was already saved, I did not create it as requested. I just rebooted the system without the nosavestate parameter. <span style="color: #BF0000"> It did not automatically connect.</span> This was in line with all previous experiences.<br>
<br>
The system was rebooted again, this time using the savestate parameter. <span style="color: #408000">It did automatically connect.</span> Those are the results I reported. My doubt is about how this will work when a USB stick has been created and booted for the very first time. If the boot parameter savestate, is required to use the setting, it will not exist at that time. <br>
<br>
How do the nosavestate/savestate parameters work?<br>
e.g. if the nosave parameter is given is the use of saved settings prevented for that single boot-up, or for every boot-up until the save parameter is given?<br>
<br>
Is this stuff documented somewhere?<br>
<br>
Tomorrow I will create a fresh USB antiX and test that.</div>

you can just delete the save state folders to save you making a fresh stick.<br>
<br>
I think this will work. all we are doing is putting the additional info for your eth1 in the interfaces file, now matter how it gets there. ceni doesn't do anything magically, its just an editor for the interfaces file at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
the real question is does the additional information conflict anything. possibly, but i doubt it since you are able to configure your network manually in ceni already. I've had no problems so far booting with additional (non functional) entires in my etc/network/interfaces.</div>

I think what you are seeing is some leftover code. there is now a script in play that tries to figure out which broadcom driver to use for a given part. The script was originally written for MX, which does use network-manager.<br>

Open /usr/local/bin/BroadcomStartup as root and comment out all entries for <br>

<li>If these are intended to be common it will be better if the documents are consistent with each other</li>
<li>Present <em>all parameters</em> in a single block/table within the document, together with a reference for each individual parameter in the block/table, to which distro version introduced it.

<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Suggestions<br>
1) If these are intended to be common it will be better if the documents are consistent with each other<br>
2) Present all parameters in a single block/table within the document, together with a reference for each individual parameter in the block/table, to which distro version introduced it. This simplification will make it more readily apparent what is available and whether it is applicable to the particular case the user is researching. This will enhance any other sections in the document that provide more detailed information.</div></blockquote>Good thoughts, thanks. <br>
<br>
I added the antiX-15 new items for a short-term solution, but the ideal would be to avoid the duplication altogether. Not sure that's going to happen...</div>

It looks like the idea to ship with multiple entries in / etc/network/interfaces should work.<br>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>anticapitalista wrote:</cite>SamK - for conky, is it simply enough to add an eth1 entry that is basically a copy of the eth0 one to .conkyrc?</div></blockquote>Yes that's basically it. The following is what I tested, placed between the eth0 and wlan0 sections in ~/.conkyrc.<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>${if_up eth1}${color}eth1 up: $alignr${color3} ${upspeed eth1}

${color}eth1 down: $alignr${color3} ${downspeed eth1}
