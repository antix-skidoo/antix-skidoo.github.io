<div class="content">Hi there,<br>
<br>
I'm David. I'm a new antix user having totally wiped my machine of windows xp and solely using antix now. Although I asked these questions before, some good folks advised me to ask these separately so that it is easier for people to search for and find these in future. I don't mind asking again if y'all don't mind giving your great answers afresh.<br>
<br>
I've got a Windows Phone (WP8, nokia lumia 720). I've searched and found no clear way of connecting it to my computer to browse the phone files or its micro sd card without removing it and using a memory card reader. I'm not sure if Android solutions will work for Windows Phone as Windows Phone doesn't have a file manager like android so there is no real"browse" option in its Internet Explorer when uploading files. <br>
<br>
Could anyone point me to instructions known to work?</div>

<div class="content">Hi hesedyahu,<br>
<br>
I've transferred the following reply from your previous multiple question post, to keep things in one place.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>hesedyahu wrote:</cite>2) I've got a windows mobile phone (wp8, nokia lumia). I've searched and found now clear way of connecting it to browse the phone files or its sd card without removing it and using a memory card reader.

<br>
You do not mention which version of antiX you are using or whether it is using apps from the Stable or Unstable (Testing) branch. Taking a guess that you have installed antiX-13.2-Stable...<br>
<br>
After the release of 13.2 an app named Droopy was recently added to the repo so it couldn't be included in the installation media you downloaded. Because of this you have to install it separately at present. <br>
<br>
It is a simple way of transferring files over a network connection. It also allows tranfers to and from a smart 'phone.<br>
<br>
You can read about how to install it in the announcement<br>
droopy-available-t4893.html<br>
<br>
You can read more detail about it in the FAQ <br>

<br>
You can watch a video about it on Youtube<br>

<div class="content">I tried Droopy. I installed it on the computer. I followed the instructions as best I could but when it came to typing the ip address with the 8800 at the end into the browser of my devices, neither my windows phone nor my android tablet could get to the website. On my windows phone it says<br>
<br>
"We're having trouble displaying this page.<br>
We're having trouble with the page you're trying to reach and can't open it at the moment.<br>
Try the following:<br>
* refresh the page or try again later<br>
Error: HTTP 504 Gateway timeout"<br>
<br>
My android device just thinks and thinks and thinks and then says:<br>
<br>
"Web page not available<br>
The webpage at http://[my ip]:8800/ might be temporarily down or it may be moved permanently to a new web address.<br>
Here are some suggestions:<br>
* check to make sure that your device has a signal and data connection<br>
* reload this webpage later.<br>
* View a cached copy of the web page from Google"<br>
<br>
According to the droopy website, it says that I may be behind a firewall or NAT router. Is there a way I can find out? The webpage says"Configure them to allow connections on port 8800 of your computer." Would a NAT router be the router my home broadband is on? I haven't set up a firewall in antix. Is one set up by default?</div>

<div class="content">are you using the mobile network, or wifi? <br>
In my case, it works fine, if I use the wifi on the phone.<br>
If you use the mobile network, your router will block it from getting into your local network.<br>
<br>
Well, I am not a network guru, so that is how I think it works.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks. I tried following the instructions for Droopy on a youtube video by runwiththedolphins (or something like that) and that didn't work. And now after reading the instructions on the faq for droopy online, I found out what I was doing wrong. I was using the wrong ip address. The Droopy video didn't tell me this but the instructions online showed that the correct ip address was at the top of the droopy windows. Using that I got to the right webpage where I could at least download files from my PC on a Windows Phone.<br>
<br>
But just a warning to anyone with a Windows Phone, you can't transfer files from your phone to the computer. You CAN transfer from the computer to the phone, but not from the phone to the computer. In order for the transfer to work, the operating system needs a file manager. Windows Phone doesn't have a file manager. So when you click on the browse button on the Droopy page, it will be unresponsive. So there is still no way, no simple way, no straight forward way to transfer a file from windows phone to a computer. <br>
<br>
I tried using my sd card, and using a card reader and going through the irritating task of removing the sd card from the phone, putting into the sd card into the reader and the reader into the computer. But - maybe my sd card is weak - but I think I've managed to corrupt my micro sd card in the process and it's wiped out most of my music and photos. Now I'm going to see if I can repair it.</div>
