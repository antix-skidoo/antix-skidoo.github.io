<div class="content">I like SpaceFM a lot. But by default it doesn't support a trashcan: delete a file and it is really gone. Many users will consider this a drawback. In his video 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWebvzhFtjo"<br>linktext was:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWebvzhFtjo"<br>====================================<br>
, Dolphin_Oracle explains how to add trashcan support to SpaceFM by installing the Corbeille plugin. However, there is an alternative plugin developed by Tri Le that has somewhat different features. Before giving some instructions on how to install that plugin (easy if you have seen D_O's video), a short explanation about the differences between the two.<br>
<br>
The Corbeille plugin only provides a trashcan for the root filesystem. This is by design, and on his website the developper explains that there may be good reasons for NOT supporting a trash system on, e.g., removable drives. Tri Le's plugin on the other hand, while having less features than Corbeille, provides a trashcan on each mounted (and writable) filesystem. The trashcan for the root file system is located - as usual - in the users home directory. Deleting a file on a mounted file system puts it in a per-user trashcan in the top level of that file system. At the same time, symbolic links to it are stored in the main trashcan /home/$user$/.local/share/Trash/files. You can easily imagine that inconsistencies may arise if file system mount points get changed. For my particular setup however, with quite a few different hard disks, but on stable mount points, I decided to give it a try, and it works well for me.<br>
<br>
To install Tri Le's plugin you need to download two separate .tar.gz archives:
<ul>
<li>A bash script (
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://code.google.com/p/bashscripts/downloads/detail?name=trash-0.4.0.tar.gz&amp;can=2&amp;q="<br>linktext was:"https://code.google.com/p/bashscripts/d ... z&amp;can=2&amp;q="<br>====================================<br>
)</li>
<li>The proper plugin (
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://code.google.com/p/bashscripts/downloads/detail?name=Trash_v0.6.3.spacefm-plugin.tar.gz&amp;can=2&amp;q="<br>linktext was:"https://code.google.com/p/bashscripts/d ... z&amp;can=2&amp;q="<br>====================================<br>
)</li></ul>
(these links are easily found by starting SpaceFM and choosing the menu item &gt;Help&gt;Get Plugins).<br>
<br>
The first one has to be extracted and the bash script in it stored in /usr/local/bin (preferably). Check that file permissions allow it to be executed. The second one must be kept in archived form. You can then install the plugin by choosing (in SpaceFM) the menu option &gt;Plugins&gt;Install&gt;File and navigating to the archived plugin that you downloaded. Trashing a file or folder can be done by selecting it, then using the SpaceFM Plugins menu's, but it's much more convenient to attach a keyboard shortcut. Keyboard shortcuts are explained much better in D_O's video than I can describe it here.</div>
