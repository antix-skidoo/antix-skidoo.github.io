<div class="content">I'd posted back in the day (a year ago) about having trouble running M7 on my old 800Mhz machine. Today I downloaded 7.5 and have the same issue, you can see the old post 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://antix.freeforu ms.org/kernael-panic-not-syncing-vfs-unable-to-mount-root-fs-on-t113.html"<br>linktext was:"http://antix.freeforu ms.org/kernael-pan ... -t113.html"<br>====================================<br>
" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false<br>
Here's some highlights as a refresher:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Tyan Thunderbolt 440GX chipset, dual 800Mhz PII, 256MB, 18GB SCSI drive on an Adaptec 7896. I install and try to boot from the HD I get:"Kernael panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)" </div></blockquote>
I've gotten this error on all versions of antiX I've tried (6.5, 7 and now 7.5) I also get it with Mepis 7 but interestingly not with Ubuntu 6...<br>
<br>
Then anticapitalista asked <blockquote class="uncited"><div>Using the livecd, can you navigate to /mnt/hda (or where your installed antiX-M7 is)/etc/fstab and post it here. Also the same for the boot/grub/menu.lst</div></blockquote>
Its a SCSI harddrive remember so its /sda<br>
<br>
# /etc/fstab: static file system information<br>
#<br>
# &lt;filesystem&gt; &lt;mount point&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;dump&gt; &lt;pass&gt;<br>

<div class="content">My guess.<br>
<br>
There is some kind of issue with the scsi drives, maybe a driver issue or a recognition problem. Ubuntu may have overcome this by using uuid's by default. Not sure if the 6.... series had moved to uuid's yet though?</div>

<div class="content">Both the file system table (/etc/fstab) and the GRUB boot loader configuration file (/boot/grub/menu.lst) appear to be very ordinary, nothing strange about either one of them. When you use a SCSI disk device it always has the sd naming convention, so that is correct.<br>
<br>
Sure seems to be a hardware recognition kind of an issue.<br>
<br>
You say that Ubuntu, at least in some versions, works, correct? Out of curiosity, do other Debian based distributions work as well? If not, perhaps there is some hardware support in Ubuntu that has not reached the stock Debian environment.<br>
<br>
As an experiment, any chance that you can grab a copy of sidux-2008-03? A Preview release was just announced this week. I wonder if their kernel has the hardware support that you need? As a data point, it would be a good version to try out for comparison. AntiX has the capability of pulling in sidux kernels - but of course, that is only true if you can at least install it initially. By trying out a sidux kernel, perhaps we can figure out if a newer Debian or sidux kernel will have the device support you need or not. If yes, then maybe the version of antiX that is being worked on right now will help you out.<br>
<br>
Worth a try to get more data on the source of the problem?</div>

I still hope that we will be able to figure out a way to get antiX going for you because it is such a great small system, but sidux is a really cool cutting edge distro as well - and anti himself likes it. Maybe if you can get sidux going we can help you figure out what is going wrong and come up with a solution to help you get antiX successfully installed and running too.</div>

I was going to reply from the system but its got one of the old type clicker keyboards, drives me crazy, gotta replace that.<br>
<br>
Anyway Sidux works perfectly, or it works fine anyway, or it boots fine and goes online anyway. I don't like Konqueror much but it does seem to be working.<br>
<br>
So far overall I prefer antiX except that Sidux works.</div>

<div class="content">If sidux works, that is an indication that the sidux kernel - and perhaps the Ubuntu kernel as well (that worked too, right?) have device support not currently available in the antiX kernel from the SimplyMEPIS project.

That makes sense since Mepis 7 failed in exactly the same way antiX does. Ubuntu 6 worked, I haven't tried a newer version as I really don't like Ubuntu 6.<br>
There was another download available for Sidux, I forget what it was, appeared to be a different window manager...<br>
<br>
I'd appreciate a short tutorial on how to swap out KDE...<br>

We might be able to get antiX to work still.<br>
As you managed to install it, I guess antiX-M7.5 did work as a livecd.<br>
We might be able to use the information from the sidux install to boot antiX.<br>
Could you post the contents of these 2 sidux files.<br>
<br>
/boot/grub/menu.lst<br>
/etc/fstab<br>
<br>
What you might want to try is create another partition for antiX to go on and install to.<br>
If you get the same problem ie antiX not booting, you can use the livecd and or the sidux partition to edit the antiX /etc/fstab and /boot/grub/menu.lst.<br>
<br>
I think erie got it right, that you may need to change references of sda to UUID</div>
