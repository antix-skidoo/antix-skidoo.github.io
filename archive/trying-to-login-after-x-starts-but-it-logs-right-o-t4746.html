<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I think AntiX 13.2 might be my favorite live distribution so far mainly in my case because it's so low on resources and still has a debian base. I'm having a problem though on a laptop which I installed AntiX to the hdd.<br>
<br>
<strong>History:</strong><br>
<br>
I decided to go from stable to testing so I changed the apt/sources.list to reflect the change removing the stable and adding the testing by editing the appropriate hash marks. Then I ran apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade.<br>
<br>
<strong>Current Problem:</strong><br>
I rebooted after a dist-upgrade and it starts up slim with the login prompt and I enter my login name and password and then I see the desktop for 2 seconds then it immediately logs me out and I'm returned to the slim (standard gui login screen). I have been able to login as root though. Nothing was changed besides the upgrade to testing repository.<br>
<br>
<strong>Looked at /var/log/slim.log and it repeats </strong><br>
slim: waiting for X server to begin accepting connections.<br>
slim: open_session: Unable to open session: Process /usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper received signal 11<br>
followed later by<br>
slim: unexpected signal 15<br>
<br>
<strong>Looked at ~/.xsession-errors:0.0</strong><br>
Last section of error log shows:<br>
Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 keyConky: can't open display: :0.0<br>
***** ImLib2 Developer Warning ***** :<br>
This program is calling the Imlib call:<br>
imlib_context_free();<br>
With the parameter:<br>
context<br>
being NULL. Please fix your program.<br>
<br>
Btw still new to this and if you have any files I need to run or check can you be a little specific with it and include file paths if possible. <br>
<br>
Any ideas? Thanks for any help</div>

<div class="content">Signal 11 is a segmentation fault. It means a program was trying to access memory it is not allowed to touch. Since this happened right after a software upgrade, I suspect it means something is really screwed up in some of the software you installed. Most likely there is a version mismatch between a library and an application program that uses that library. This could cause miscommunication and result in a segfault.<br>
<br>
The other possibility is that your hardware suddenly went bad but I think this is unlikely.<br>
<br>
It might be possible to track down which program is seg-faulting but it might be much better to have someone give you instructions on how to redo the repo change and upgrade correctly. I don't know how to do this but there should be people here tomorrow who can help you. From what little I know, changing repos like this is fraught with peril. It is possible they will suggest you do a re-install.</div>

<div class="content">The system I had running which would immediately log out after seeing the desktop load up for 2 seconds was an installed antix from a livecd. <br>
I'm finishing up a complete reinstall and did a full format and check of the 2 resized partitions I put it on. It is an old laptop which had Windows 2000 on it. 256meg RAM, 1 Ghz PIII &amp; 30 Gig HD which I gave about 8 Gig to Antix and a 600 Meg Swap. This time I chose the testing repo during install and did an update and dist-upgrade after it was installed. It's finishing that part up and I'm going to reboot after that.<br>
<br>
A note during the dist-upgrade both times (first initially choosing stable and this second time initially choosing testing) it stopped twice in the middle with the following messages I chose YES on each one.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<em>Configuring uswsusp<br>
The swap file or partition that was found in uswsusp's configuration<br>
file is not active.<br>
In most cases this means userspace software suspend will not work as<br>
expected. You should choose another swap space.<br>
However, in some rare cases, this configuration may be intentional.<br>
Continue without a valid swap space?</em><br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<em>Configuring libc6:i386<br>
There are services installed on your system which need to be restarted<br>
when certain libraries, such as libpam, libc, and libssl, are upgraded.<br>
Since these restarts may cause interruptions of service for the system,<br>
you will normally be prompted on each upgrade for the list of services<br>
you wish to restart. You can choose this option to avoid being<br>
prompted; instead, all necessary restarts will be done for you<br>
automatically so you can avoid being asked questions on each library<br>
upgrade.<br>
Restart services during packages upgrades without asking?</em><br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The sources list I never changed from the downloaded Antix 13.2 live CD which I directly and immediately ran install after boot (Edit: I just had to run WiCD to get the usb net adapter working first). I am at a handicap now and can't post it cause it's doing the dist-upgrade a second time from this 2nd install. <br>
I will also post the .xinitrc for you too if I come up with the same issue. <br>
BTW is the .xinitrc the script that starts the apps/services during starting the X environment?<br>
<br>
I forgot earlier and I should bring it up now is that there have been issues with it booting from USB. The BIOS doesn't support it so I installed plop boot manager from a ploplinux CD which allows booting from the USB. For some reason it just freezes during the bootup of any linux I tried booting from (with using the USB using the plop boot manager which is giving the new option to boot from USB). This is why I had burned a CD of Antix and ran the full install.<br>
<br>
Thanks very much for the information and help.</div>

<div class="content">OK the plot thickens. Reinstall originally from testing gives the same results. Login which quickly logs out. It's looking that I didn't run as many tests as I should have. Guest (my account for now) and Root both function identically as noted below. I might have originally (during first install) tried to log in using jwm as root and not clicked on an app to test it out which is why I originally said my guest account logs back out but the root doesn't log back out. Both seem to be doing the exact same thing:<br>
<br>
rox-fluxbox: Logs in and immediately back out<br>
space-fluxbox: Does login but starting an app logs out<br>
fluxbox: Does login but starting an app logs out<br>
rox-icewm: Logs in and immediately back out<br>
space-icewm: Logs in and immediately back out<br>
icewm: Does login but starting an app logs out<br>
rox-jwm: Logs in and immediately back out<br>
space-jwm: Logs in and immediately back out<br>
jwm: Does login but starting an app logs out<br>
wmii: Logs into a black desktop with no seeming left or right click action but a small vertical line on the top that can be dragged left and right horizontally (very strange)<br>
<br>
I'm trying now to figure out how I can send over (or paste) those files you asked for if the laptop doesn't open to a X gui. I will work on that probably mounting a flash drive.</div>

<div class="content">did everything work before the dist-upgrade?<br>
<br>
are you sure the dist-upgrade completed successfully? I tried to do one this morning with the testing repos (32 bit) and I had to restart the operation twice to complete.<br>
<br>
if you can get to the command prompt, try running as root apt-get install -f and then apt-get dist-upgrade again.<br>
<br>
if you have the grub boot, select the option that says init 3 to boot to a command prompt.</div>

<div class="content">@dolphin, by the way the install original 2 dist-upgrades returned to the command line without any errors. (Just the 2 confirmations in the middle of installation as I mentioned in my earlier post) I'm curious though about you mentioning you had to"restart the operation twice to complete". Do you recall where during the upgrade it did this.</div>

<div class="content">Mine just looked like it finished, but it didn't. I had problems with x starting. I noticed in the dist-upgrade there was quite a bit of xserver stuff getting upgraded. I also had a error concerning libaudit0 being removed but being a dependency for systemd and xserver-xorg-core, but the dist-upgrade continued and removed it. But my"testing" system is still working, but I though it was worth passing on.</div>

<div class="content">Your problem sounds similar to a distro that didn't create a /home/user dir when installing. <br>
Perhaps check that the permissions haven't been altered (?).</div>

<div class="content">Before linux-image-3.7.10-antix.7-486-smp was"finalized" and offered as a complete iso on sourceforge, I used the apt-get dist-upgrade steps listed at the antix.mepis main page, dated 5 November 2013. Somebody had mentioned about having to apt-get dist-upgrade TWICE as root terminal to make sure ALL the libs loaded properly. I was just getting in to antiX and hadn't realized the way things were working weren't NORMAL.<br>
<br>
Once the 12 Nov release of the"finalized" image was out, I downloaded it and installed it. Haven't really had a problem with it since. But then I'm still in kindergarten learning (actually relearning) coding.<br>
<br>
They get 3 hot meals a day, all the drugs they want, get to watch tv most of the day, and don't have to work. Now think who is CRAZY?,</div>

<div class="content">Also check that the home directory isn't full.<br>
<br>
You could try boooting using the init 3 option and at the black screen, type usernabe and password then startx.<br>
<br>
If this works, then there is an issue with either slim login manger or something in /home. Possibly your .xinitrc file permissions got changed to root?<br>
<br>
Also, post etc/slim.conf</div>
