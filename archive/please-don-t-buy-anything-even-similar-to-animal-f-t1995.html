<div class="content">In this time of globalisation, no matter what the label says (like 'Made in EU' or 'fake fur'), most fur comes from China.<br>
They come from all kind of animals that had the helliest of life and death.<br>

Our life unfolds in many dimensions, everything is interconnected.<br>
I'll share you an episode lived by a fellow countryman, now 48 years old:<br>
"There was an occasion, I was 13 years old, a kid started mocking me because I didn't eat meat and proposed that we should fight to see who was the strongest. Since he was bigger than me I was beaten and came back home offended. I went directly to bed and thought: 'is it worth to fight for the animals?'. I had an impactant dream, with a man that came to talk to me, with an oriental face, wearing a turban. He said me: 'Look what happens to the animals. Look how they suffer with the sacrifice inflicted on them by humanity'. I saw the scenes, thousands of animals groaning, all in naked blood, skinned. Then the man in my dream asked: 'Isn't it worth to fight because of their suffering?'. I woke up ashamed and never questioned anymore."</div>
