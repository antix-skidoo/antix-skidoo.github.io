<div class="content">Today I discovered this on github<br>
<strong>Here I am quoting only the initial post ~~ clickthru to read the followup posts.</strong><blockquote class="uncited"><div>
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/687"<br>linktext was:"https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues/687"<br>====================================<br>

Hello to all,<br>
<br>
This repo of SpaceFM is no longer in active development (you're still welcome to use this issue tracker).<br>
I just want to bring attention to a fork which is being worked on by @Teklad called spacefm-ng.<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://github.com/Teklad/spacefm-ng"<br>linktext was:"https://github.com/Teklad/spacefm-ng"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
He has forked from SpaceFM 1.0.5+next, and has fixed some of the bugs reported here. <br>
He has also worked on documentation, etc., and has merged some work from others.<br>
I was just made aware of this fork, so I haven't reviewed it in detail, but according to @OmegaPhil it's the strongest fork going.<br>
<br>
Also, if you would like to run alpha but with his bugfixes and changes, you might be able to merge his work into alpha fairly easily, as I mentioned in spacefm-ng issue 6. alpha usually runs quite well and has some nice features and improvements - quite a bit of work went into it, but it didn't quite make it to release.<br>
<br>
Translators: Please note that SpaceFM's Transifex server is populated with files from alpha (I just pulled the updates into alpha today - thanks for the work!) These are missing many strings used in next, so these files won't work well with next (or with Teklad's master branch). However, it is possible to merge po files - there are tools to do that. I also discuss this in spacefm-ng issue 6.<br>
<br>
Finally, please note that my old email address, [<span style="color: silver">redacted</span>], is effectively gone, yet it doesn't seem to be bouncing mail yet, it just vanishes. My new openmailbox email address may be obtained from my updated PGP key.<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>

<div class="content">AFAIK, the source tree on which debian builds are based<br>
comes from, starts from, here:

Mateusz ≈Åukasik might not be listed as the debian"package maintainer", but he's a prolific contributor toward maintaing various packages. He's already begun merging changes using"spacefm-ng" as the upstream. So far, most of the commits seem to be fixes to deal with breakage under GTK3.</div>
