<div class="content">These are a few:<br>
<br>
1. Starvation kills over 40.000.000 people a year.<br>
Answer:<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
There is plenty of food in the world, plenty of soil all we have to do is to plant, not to wait for burocracy to give these people the food. Humans can be self sufficient these must be taught if they do not know. If there is no soil for planting then it is a crime not react fast with responsability to make sure that these people have the food without the burocracy intervention..<br>
<br>
2. Ozone of the Earth atmosphere is in very bad shape.<br>
<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
Change the way we use products that are harmful, change the structure to a more natural heathier form.<br>
<br>
3. Marine species are dying due to the contamination of the Sea.<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
Ban Water atomic explosions, industrial waste etc... make industrial companies etc... really responsible for unhealthy waste disposal.<br>
<br>
4. Pollution in the air is very high and getting worst.<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
There many healthier options, Option of using water, air, electrical etc... means instead of gas use. It is not recomended to use food for moving vehicles. we will really exhausted the soil. There is plenty known and unknown alternatives instead of using out there.<br>
<br>
5. Pollution in drinking waters.<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
Schools system must teach kids about these issues, Industry must pay a real high price, because they are the greatest polluters.<br>
<br>
6. Exhausted dry Earth top soil and Subsoil.<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
Stop using quimicals or artificial processes in the soil all GM crops soil within a few years the soil becomes dry and completly death. not good for anyhting.<br>
<br>
Use alternative plants, animal, bugs, etc.... to get ready off bugs that kill crops. Plant Organic only!<br>
<br>
7 Home Toxics quimicals.<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
Do not buy these products. There is no need if you want to keep your home free of toxics. there are many natural alternatives stronger than most chemicals.<br>
<br>
8. Food toxics, Genetic Modification, quimical and cloning of food.<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
Buy Organic food only. You will see that with time Organic food will be cheaper than GM food, if we are persistant. On top, your body will accept it better.<br>
<br>
9. Atomic Waste, Weapons waste, industrial waste , machines waste, quimical waste. etc.... etc....<br>
Some Suggestions:<br>
Complain and make everyone know around you about the waste and health hazzard. Complain!<br>
<br>
The first question is who it is responsible for all this destruction? <br>
<br>
The second question is where would it lead us into the future.<br>
<br>
The third question is what are some things that we can do as solo individuals to help?<br>
<br>
Here are a few tips to help fight the greater war for our own future survival:<br>
<br>
1. Do not throw away through your home sink, toilet or home, or soil any quimical products. Look for proper disposal of it. You can find out yes by calling the city to get ready off it. <br>
<br>
2. keep away any quimical cans, spray, boxes, detergents etc....from inside your home. Rather put these if you are going to use it, outside in garage or in a box lock, outside away from inside the home. It is better to use natural products for cleaning like Lemon, Orange, Eucaliptus, oils, are great cleaners. You can learn about this in the net and then instruct your wife, mom etc... if you are a man? Teach your kids.<br>
<br>
You can avoid to buy these if you choose the natural way. All these sprays, cans do have fumes or vapors that are continually going into the air you breath inside your home even if not in use.<br>
<br>
3. If you are not going to use your electrical plugs, cover these with plastic covers, try to keep these away from your body when sleeping the furthest posible from it. Usually 10 feet will be OK. Electrical energy radiates out through this open plugs.<br>
<br>
4. Stay away from celullars as much as you can. These radiates a similar microwave energy that destroys the finer membranes of you brain. These finer membranes separates the brain from toxins, when this finer membranes break then the toxics will enter your brain and could create a brain tumor. <br>
<br>
Microwave food does not have any vitamins left after been expose to it's radiation. Do not eat from microwave if you can avoided.<br>
<br>
Do this test yourself: Put a hard banana or any fruit beside a cellular overnight and you will see the reullt the morning after, soft almost like watering it becomes.<br>
<br>
Imagine when full power, when you are using it straight into your ear canal and your brain membranes? <br>
<br>
Children under 16 should not be allow to use celullars, If you are using it, avoid to have long conversations. keep celullars away from ear as further as posible and keep it away from your body yes pick it up when it rings but avoid having it on you. You can put it on your car seat, or on top of your desk at least 7 feet from you if it is posible.<br>
<br>
5. Try to use solar or air vents system for home heating, air, and lights if posible if not follow the recomendations above.<br>
<br>
6. Buy only Organic food. If you can't then, there is a listt at green peace.com that will tell you which products are not Genetic modified. <br>
<br>
7. The cleanest water tested is the one from the rain, lakes, and these have a natural cleansing process. learn how to check the water if is any good for consumption.<br>
<br>
Bottle water is more safe than normal sink water.<br>
<br>
8. Put filters in your bathtub douche. City Water Quimical vapors are harmful to breath and for your skin. After you have put one of these in your tub you will see the differences in your skin and hair.<br>
<br>
9. Do not use fluoride in your tooth paste if you can, use organic plants tooth paste will be the best choice. Many countries have a ban on fluoride due to the chemical created changes in the brain that affects people intellectual capacity and more on children. Is been research that it also affects the hyper tension in children.<br>
<br>
10. If you can give home food to children so they eat rather the food from home, avoid restaurants and fast food. <br>
<br>
11. Plant everyday at least one plant anywhere if you are not planting at least, throw the seeds where ever you go. Make sure these seeds don't come from genetic modified food.<br>
<br>
Don't throw away apples, oranges etc... seeds rather throw these to the ground or any ground if posible.<br>
<br>
12. Give your plants and your soil rather the food that you thrown away to the trash (Not meat) you will see your plants growing fast and beautifully you don't need quimicals in your plants for these to grow beautifuly or healthy.<br>
<br>
13. For health issues the above will also help a lot. i will do my own recommendations about health at the next post.<br>
<br>
Understand that I have taken the time to learn about all this through reading and researching because I care for this world my family and me. So if you don't agree with something here, please I will recomend from my part to go ahead and research about this information and look into places that are not political or economical gainers.<br>
<br>
Tell your friends, family and get involve if you can.<br>
<br>
It is our own, for us, and the future responsability for future generations. We are not going to seat down and wait for anyone or burocracy to make these changes because so far nothing has been done because greed is in the middle of everything. <br>
<br>
Well any questions that it is up to my reach can be posted here.</div>

<div class="content">For me the problem can be summed up in one word.<br>
Capitalism<br>
<br>
... and the solution in one word too.<br>
Socialism<br>
<br>
So what can each individual do in the here and now? Well I agree with some of your suggestions, but ultimately an individual needs to organise to overthrow the capitalist system. Not an easy task, but the only solution in my opinion.</div>

Good point anticapitalista. I agree with Capitalism issue, but many socialist systems today are falling in the grasp of Capitalism, thereofore to me socialism, communism, nationalism have fall into the Capitalism idea.<br>
<br>
I lived communism, capitalism, nationalism, and social democracy I saw social democracy using capitalism ideas also. Socialism is a very good system but when it is fully apply. I do agree with you 100% but the problems will continue as long as we don't get ready off greed and materialist ideas which capitalism uses as their greater weapon and this weapon has cause a degenerated spiritual , hate, envy, greed competitive, humanity etc...<br>
<br>
Most of Humanity must understand that it must choose between life or death and so far it is choosing everything that creates death or help this process of death by accepting it. Most of Humanity must mature from death and that it is why all this things will get worse, until we all get the rope in the neck, is then when socialism will triumph or any other system more pure and natural when it surfaces. Counting on many for anything it is a hardtask if not imposible today.<br>
<br>
Most of humanity today does not have<br>
a light within, only has accepted the darkness into their homes. Most of Humanity has gone into such a degeneration that a handshake is not longer trustful. The Material world has offer us plenty of toys for us but all this toys have something in common, all of these harm you one way or the other. <br>
<br>
<br>
I do agree with your caring opinion.</div>

<div class="content">Capitalism and socialism are not political systems but, rather, economic philosophies. They are nothing more (or less ) than concepts, ideas, theories until they are put into practice in a society at which point they become political. <br>
<br>
In theory, capitalism offers economic freedoms, incentives, and individual opportunity. Socialism, in theory, promises economic security and economic &amp; social equity. <br>
<br>
In practice, however, capitalism inevitably becomes driven by greed while socialism promotes economic dependency and places the individual at the"mercy" of the state (a concept to which capitalism is not completely foreign, as well). <br>
<br>
My point is this. Neither system is perfect and both have their pros and cons. Neither system can be singularly blamed for life's woes nor can either system be offered as the solution. While both systems work in theory they are both, in practice, susceptible to human corruption. <br>
<br>
The problem is not social, political, or economic. The problem is spiritual. Human nature is inherently corrupt and, apart from divine intervention, will remain so. There is no social, political, or economic fix for that. The problem is sin. The solution is Jesus Christ. <br>

<div class="content">I did not want to touch the religious point but now that someone came out with the truth I will have to support it over 1000% +++....<br>
<br>
Moron You hit right into the light! Even know I do not follow any particualar religion I really has put a lot emphasy in Jesus, buda, abraham, and others words, but specially Jesus he is the man, the greatest phylosopher, the greatest love, the greatest educated and so on.....He said I have come here to tell you that what I have done you can do it too and what I am you should be. This is one of the greatest gift to me that he left here of all his gifts. He told us to try to be like him to follow the greatest of the Universesal law which is to choose life, love, because all living things are sacred gifts giving from the father. We are all special and life is special gift giving to us but it is the acceptance of the darkness that does not allow people to see the light within, the essence of a hidden inner Love that will have to be realize through your own desicion, so it can spark from the deepest of all darkness and then it becomes the light that no longer darkens you, your family and your environment. This a great time to change to look for the only truth which is unconditional Love.<br>
<br>
Best Regards and Great Point for you!<br>
<br>
Right to the point Moron! Congratulations!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sakasa,<br>
Make no mistake about it, my good friend. It's not religion I'm talking about. It's faith. <br>

Well I would agree with this comment. It depends though where you put your faith and in what. I have no problem with others having religious faith or religious belief of any form, even though I am an atheist.<br>
<br>
My faith is in people's (not all people, of course) ability to change the world for the better and create a world where people come before profit, in fact a world where capitalist economic exploitation and social oppression is thrown into 'the dustbin of history'.</div>

Anticapitalist I use to be also atheist until my life, my mind, my heart started to search for truth and I found that by understanding profoundly nature, what it offers us, then I understood Jesus words and the faith like moron explains. I understood the unlimited resources of nature, it's mechanism, obligations and the unlimited faithful resource that when we need it it is always there for goodness, to cure us, to give us life. Even know most humans work in the process of destroying it, still she is there for us to give us life and this is Nature. So I comprehended Jesus as been as the same, doing the same and giving us the same approach as mother nature, unconditional love. This is why I understood him and believe in him. Please understand that I'm writing this not for you to change your view but I'm only writing to you to let you know my own self experience. I do love everything that has to do with real true love and I know that you have a great heart maybe bigger than your entire being and it is this what makes you special and it is this heart that cares faithfully about human suffering. I believe that people like Moron and you, are messengers of Goodness and there are more in this special forum like you. I really feel full and great to have being able to meet a few good men in this forum.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time.</div>
