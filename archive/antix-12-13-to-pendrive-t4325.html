<div class="content">Hi, hope you can advise. I have all sorts of printout information to do with loading Antix to a pendrive but I think the advice changes with builds. Maybe.<br>
<br>
I would like to put Antix base on to a pen drive as a live and root persistent os. I figure it's half the size of a full installation and can be run lean.<br>
<br>
I have 'antix-12-base-486.iso' which I wrote to the pendrive with unetbootin but it refused to kick off.<br>
Probably because I have an Ge-force card although it could also be because I have to use 'Plop' to manage booting on a BIOS that does not support usb.<br>
<br>
Well, that was the direct route but then I thought I could use the later build 'antix-13-beta_386-full.iso' written to CD live, set up persistance, strip it down or not and do a snapshot iso, which I thought to write to another drive. Then I could use unetbootin to load that onto the pendrive. <br>
<br>
So then I got confused and I thought maybe it would be better to post a question as I am probably going about this all wrong anyway.<br>
<br>
I don't mind fiddling about if I was sure of the 'route' to go down.<br>
<br>
I had 'Antix-12-full' running nicely but I was conscious that even as I cut it down for my set-up I was still carrying all that un-nessessary baggage and there was an issue with double menus which I see is fixed in 13.<br>
<br>
My main program is gimp.<br>
<br>
So what do you think, advice please ?</div>

<div class="content">The best thing to do IMO is to wait until the final gets released and start with base version.<br>
I'm busy this weekend and out of town, so it won't be ready until, hopefully, around 26 May.<br>
<br>
If you want to test, try the latest beta and add the patch and UNetbootin should work ok to install to usb.<br>
You'll have to set up persistence after wards.<br>
<br>
xdelta3-patch-testers-needed-t4307.html<br>
<br>
Our antix2usb script/gui is nearing completion and this has the advantage of setting up persistence as you install to usb device.</div>

<div class="content">Many thanks anticapitalista, <br>
I was begining to think my question was so dumb it had upset eveybody. I will look out for the new release and in the mean time see what happens with beta and the patch. Just out of curiosity really.</div>

<div class="content">If you are pushing ahead now (which is fine), it should be easy to set up persistence after you've created a LiveUSB by going to the antiX Control Centre, choose the"Live" tab on the left and then"set up live persistence". Unetbootin should work well with the latest beta. OTOH, the"dd" method won't let you set up persistence because when you use"dd" the usb stick is a perfect clone of the LiveCD and is thus read-only.<br>
<br>
You now have an option (at boot-time) for static root persistence. Add",static" or",s" to the persist= parameter so it becomes:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>persist=root!,home,s</code></pre></div>This option makes antiX store file system changes directly on the persistence rootfs file you created. Depending on the quality of your usb stick, this can make it run very slow. On the plus side, the size of your changes are only limited by the size of the rootfs file you create.<br>
<br>
If you don't choose this option then filesystem changes are stored in RAM. This is very fast but the size of you changes is limited by how much RAM you have. The changes are copied to the rootfs file during shutdown.<br>
<br>
BTW, I think people were waiting for anti to answer you (I know I was) because he best knows the status of the antix2usb script.<br>
<br>
BTW2, if your machine refuses to boot from usb then you won't see the graphical bootloader menu and there is not much we can do about it. OTOH, if you get to the bootloader and the boot processes stops some time after you've hit &lt;Enter&gt; then that is something we can probably fix.</div>

<div class="content">Hello all... its been a while. Hoping to finally update my current antiX 8.5 setup to 13 when it's released. 8.5 is still going strong on my netbook and never had a need to update it. The only reason I'm updating it is to try refresh my Linux skills and see what's currently out</div>

<div class="content">Update: I applied the patch using code supplied. To be honest, I had no idea what to expect. What happened was pure fairy dust!<br>
This is a really sweet os, very impressive. It is quick.<br>
So everything has dropped into place even with my old GeForce card. Delighted anticapitalista.<br>
Thanks to for the static tip BitJam, I will try that.</div>
