<div class="content">Dear friends,<br>
<br>
I'm new to AntiX but had many years with ICL19xx/29xx/39xx and H'well 6x mainframes 1967-1999, and with ICL DRS/NX, SCO, other Unix, and Xenix. I can use vi and simple scripts. I was a migration specialist. I'm now just an old pensioner using junk PCs.<br>
<br>
I picked AntiX for its claimed easy install on old boxes, and it certainly does that! Some distributions fail to install, or give weird problems.<br>
<br>
I installed AntiX on aa ancient PC which it shares with WinXP, my wife's choice. This dates from about 1999, built for Win98, XP overloads it, making it next to unusable. Drives are 20g [HD0] 30g [HD1]. Partitions are WinXP [sda1,NTFS,20g], XP swap [sdb1,NTFS,2g], AntiX swap [sdb2,2g], AntiX 13.2 32bit [sdb3,ext4,25g]. ADSL adapter is a Thomson [Alcatel] one-touch, at the end of miles of copper wire.<br>
<br>
AntiX detected my internet service provider seamlessly, I was on the air immediately, full marks ! Everything works, USB, sound, graphics, the lot ! AntiX runs very fast, doing jobs twice as fast as XP, many jobs faster than that. AntiX 13.2 is a distribution of great merit. <br>
<br>
I have a few questions, which you will laugh at, but here goes :-<br>
<br>
1. At the install dialog, are F4 options additive or exclusive ?<br>
<br>
2. PC has a Spanish keyboard, to get English language in the install dialogs I specify an English UK keyboard. Near the end I specify Spanish as the session keyboard required. But I always get a UK keyboard at bootup, and need to change it in Control Centre. How can I get the Spanish keyboard to default after bootup ?<br>
<br>
3. Gparted mounts any existing linux partitions during install. Unmounting causes them to be mounted again. So I cannot remove or modify them. I have to make sure they are absent at install time, or are as I want them. What am I doing wrong ?<br>
<br>
4. How can I make my preferred WM the default ? I logout and use the F1 selection dialog for a different WM, but next boot returns me to the original WM, discarding any change.<br>
<br>
5. Occasionally at bootup, either desktop icons, or Conky or both, don't appear. I bring them up with desktop options, but how can I coerce them ?<br>
<br>
6. I use SpaceFM as preferred filer, but would like to learn about the others. Rox appears to have no cut/paste function. Am I wrong, and if so, where is it ? MC seems very powerful, I have been deterred from experimentation.<br>
<br>
7. I need to mount the XP partition [sda1] to access XP files. How can I do this without a SU mount ? I would like to automount /dev/sda1 during the boot process.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your time and your responses.<br>
<br>

<div class="content">1. They are exclusive in the sense that you can only select one at a time using the menu. However, you can specify more than one cheat code manually on the option box displayed under the menu entries. If you are using a liveUSB, you can use the F7 options to save a custom entry. <br>
<br>
2. put this in your preferred wm's startup file : setxkbmap -layout es<br>
<br>
3. I haven't seen that problem, but antiX will install to a mounted partition. you just need to specify the correct partition on the custom option in the installer. And are you are sure its gparted doing the mounting? It could be spacefm's desktop if you are using spacefm.<br>
<br>
4. There is an option in the control center (I believe on the session tab) to set a default wm/desktop combination.<br>
<br>
5. This was a known problem in antiX 13. It has been resolved in antiX 15 (at least so far). In antiX 13, I generally left conky off when using spacefm desktop.<br>
<br>
6. rox often does things its own way. There is a copy/paste, but it requires direct entry of the destination path. rox was design to be primarly drag and drop, so its actually usually easier to just open two rox windows and drag between them.<br>
<br>
7. is this live or installed? if installed, you can edit your / etc/fstab file and find the entry for sda1. change the"noauto" to"auto" and you should be mounted at startup. If running live, I believe there is a F4 menu entry for"auto mount" or something like that, that will automount all your internal partitions at boot.<br>

While we are happy to answer questions, it is traditional to use a separate thread for each question. It makes the answers easier for others to find later. And threads are free!<br>

Mod response. What he said +1.<br>

A descriptive thread title for each question in its own will make searching easier for answers. Help (not saying you are doing this) is not a descriptive thread title.<br>
