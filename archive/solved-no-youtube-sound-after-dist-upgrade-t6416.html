<div class="content">Well, I took a chance today and did a dist-upgrade on my Antix-15 installation. Among other things, this replaced Iceweasel with Firefox-ESR. I looked in the Plug-ins Manager to see the flash player situation and it told me to upgrade the Adobe Flash Player to the latest version. I did so by downloading a tar.gz file from the Adobe website and following the instructions in the readme file. After this, the Plug-in Manager no longer had the warning that the flash player was out of date and insecure. So far, so good.<br>
<br>
However, when I went to Youtube to play a music video there was no sound. The dist-upgrade also upgraded SMTube, so I went there and successfully played the same video using mpv as the backend player. I use only Alsa, by the way.<br>
<br>
I don't know if this is relevant or not, but the dist-upgrade notified me that a few packages were no longer needed and could be autoremoved, which I did. I recall seeing at least one libgstreamer package among them. Could this have clobbered Firefox sound? I've read that doing a dist-upgrade can break some things, but it isn't clear if this is a Firefox problem or something is wrong in the system.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't know if the video in question was HTML5 or Flash. <br>
<br>
Prior to the dist-upgrade I had done a regular upgrade and noticed that some packages specific to Antix were updated.<br>
<br>
Finally, I ran Firefox-ESR from a terminal and tried to play a music video. The following error message was shown:<br>
<br>
1466286241795 addons.productaddons ERROR Request failed certificate checks: [Exception..."SSL is required<br>
and URI scheme is not Https." nsresult:"0x8000fff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED)" location:"JS frame :: <br>
resource//gre/modules/CertUtils.jsm :: checkCert :: line 145" data: no]<br>
<br>
I don't know if this has anything to do with the sound problem.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any thoughts on this.<br>
<br>

<div class="content">Thanks for the quick reply, anti. Much appreciated!<br>
<br>
Man, I so wanted to avoid using Pulse Audio. Kind of runs against the philosophy of"lightweight" that I prefer.<br>
<br>
Is Firefox-ESR the future preferred browser in Debian? The replacement of Iceweasel took me by surprise.<br>
<br>
Although I prefer to use Links2 or Dillo for browsing, sometimes I need Firefox to use a website like Amazon. Do you have any suggestions for a full-feature browser that doesn't need Pulse Audio? Would there be any problem if I try to re-install Iceweasel (or is it really on the way out)?<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
Andy</div>

<div class="content">lorijan, great suggestion thanks! That does work as you indicate, so thank you.<br>

however, it breaks the equalizer in the control center. I'll move it up the line thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Well, this is getting interesting. I tried both"solutions" and each of them worked for me. <br>
<br>
First I installed pulseaudio as suggested by anti. The Youtube videos then played with sound just fine. <br>
<br>
Second I removed pulseaudio and based on another suggestion I renamed asound.conf in the etc directory to asound.conf.old and rebooted. Once again, I got sound with the Youtube videos. And I went to the Control Center and opened the Alsa equalizer. I was able to change levels, but didn't test it otherwise as I don't use it. <br>
<br>
For now I'll stick with the second solution, althougth taking a configuration file out of action by renaming it concerns me. I'd rather modify the file knowing what went wrong. But everything I care about sound-wise does seem to be working now so I'm happy while remaining ignorant.<br>
<br>
As to alternate browsers, I have tried both Midori and Qupzilla and they were faster than Firefox. But each seemed to come up short in some way. I haven't tried Chromium, so that's on my to-do list. However, after my original post I remembered that I have Firefox installed on four other boxes and they are all synced to have the same bookmarks, etc. So that's pretty strong motivation to stick with Firefox-ESR on my notebook.<br>
<br>
One last thing. When playing Youtube videos in Firefox-ESR the CPU usage in my HP Mini 210 notebook is nearly 100%. That is why most of my video playing is via SMTube or Streamlight2. Both have much, much less CPU usage. Also, I prefer to surf the net with Links2 or Dillo, but I still want to be able to play the occassional video embedded in a news website when browsing with Firefox. <br>
<br>
I would mark this topic as SOLVED, but the solutions haven't worked for others, and the root cause remains mysterious--at least to me. So I'll leave it up to anti whether or not to consider this closed.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to this Forum for being so responsive and helpful.<br>

<div class="content">As a follow-up to DO's suggestion, I installed Chromium. I also installed PepperFlash with it. No problems as yet, including playing videos on Youtube. It was very easy to import my bookmarks from Firefox/Iceweasel and to set up Ad Blocker, too. In terms of performance, I think Chromium might have an edge over Firefox-ESR, but not by much on this hardware. <br>
<br>
I'm going to leave asound.conf inactivated (by renaming) and keep Firefox-ESR installed, as I have plenty of disk space.<br>

<div class="content">Today a routine apt-get upgrade installed a new asound.conf file in the directory etc. Firefox-ESR plays Youtube videos with sound, so the underlying root cause must have been corrected. <br>
