<div class="content">Good Morning. I'm TonyVanDam and this is my first time posting.<br>
<br>
Like some Linux Users, I used to be a Windows users. My Gateway desktop PC (which I still have for 12+ years thus far!) came with Windows Me and then I purchase Windows XP Home Edition soon after. <br>
<br>
While borrowing a friend's laptop, my first experience with Windows Vista was my last! That OS was terrible. And I already knew that Microsoft were planning to discontinue supporting Windows XP, hence the main reason why I left the Microsoft Plantation and became a Linux User.<br>
<br>
Within 4+ years of Linux experience, I've used Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE), &amp; Lubuntu. AntiX is my 5th &amp; current Linux distro.<br>
<br>
Among the 5 distros I've mention, I was using LMDE the longest. The only reason why I had to stop using LMDE was due to Team Mint's lack of interest in using the LXDE desktop environment, giving that the majority of Mint users are fans of xfce, KDE, MATE, &amp; Cinnamon. On my part, I was already having a growing interest in lightweight OS's. In my professional opinion, Lubuntu was almost a throwback between Windows Me &amp; XP as far as graphics are concern, hence why I use it for a few months.<br>
<br>
I've heard about AntiX from reading positive reviews by Mr. Brain Masinick. But I choose to"play it safe" by installing AntiX full instead of base or core. The rest is history.<br>
<br>
Not only is AntiX faster than Lubuntu, but for a lightweight distro, Antix has the potential of being the"Swiss Army Knife" of Linux distros. I can install as many software as I want and Antix is still fast enough to handle to load. And one of these days, I'll be looking forward in purchasing a used laptop (with more memory and CPU than my desktop) and see how useful AntiX can be. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Howdy and Welcome TVD. <br>
<br>
I run Antix on everything from eeepcs, M&amp;A Comapnion Netbook, Amrel 786EX laptop, IBM M41, IBM M57, Acer Aspire One 5534 laptop, IBM A22m laptop, IBM T23 Laptop, Emachine W3507 Desktop,.<br>
<br>
I run 64bit and 32 bit installs. I've got more gear than common sense. But I like being a bit flaky and irresponsible. It is more fun living life that way as far as I am concerned.<br>
When I die and my life flashes before my eyes. I wanna enjoy the show.<br>
<br>
Anyhows. We are pretty laid back here, nice intro by the way.</div>
