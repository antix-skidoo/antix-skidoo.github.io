<div class="content">This is from doplhin_oracle on Mepislovers forum, many thanks:<br>
<br>
<br>
I recently brought a EEE PC 904HA into my stable of machines. they are great little machines, with a nice 160gb HD and 1gb of ram. They also run windows xp, and rather nicely. However...I like Antix, and I've been running it for a while and I want it on this machine. Here are my explorations so far:<br>
<br>
1. I created a bootable usb key from ISO with unetbootin version 312. I used the windows version and chose the"from iso" option. It formated the USB key and created a proper boot key. NOTE: after the fact, I tried the community repo version of unetbootin. While the"from ISO" function worked with Antix, I did not have any positive result with the"Antix 8" distro option.<br>
<br>
2. the 904ha comes configured to"fast boot", which mostly means it skips the screen where you have time to select the usb key to boot from. To disable this, you must hit"F2" while the machine is posting to get to the bios, then navigate to the boot tab and deselect"fast boot option". Save and exit. NOTE: you can re-enable this option after installation if you wish. It shaves about 3 seconds off the boot time.<br>
<br>
3. Make sure the USB key is in a port. It doesn't seem to matter which port, but I always use the left one. When the EEE PC splash screen comes up, hit ESC a few times and you should get a boot menu. Select your key and continue.<br>
<br>
4. I get a strange message (undefined video mode number 317). I hit space to continue or wait 30 seconds. The rest of the boot will proceed normally.<br>
<br>
5. You should get a desktop now.<br>
<br>
6. I ran synaptic from the Antix Control Centre and updated all packages.<br>
<br>
7. I configured the wireless (atheros chipset) with WICD.<br>
<br>
8. wireless works, sound works, brightness hot keys work.<br>
<br>
9. Antix installs the eeepc-acpi-scripts vs. 1.0.04. This version does not allow the hot keys for volume to work. version 1.0.11 however, after the upgrade, does.<br>
<br>
10. With the default eeepc-acpi-scripts, the sleep combination (Fn+F1) does not work. Under icewm it brings up a window list, under flux it does nothing.<br>
<br>
11. Using the wifi combination (Fn+F2) will turn off the wifi, and it appears to restart the wifi (the light comes back on), however it has in fact broke something. I was only able to resolve this by restarting the network, and sometimes by restarting the computer. At one point things were screwed up enough that I only resolved it for now by removing the eeepc-acpi-scripts all together. Note that using the"sleep combination (Fn+F1) under flux may also have broke the wifi, I'm unsure at the moment. Working the volume controls with the version 1.0.11 scripts did not seem to break wireless.<br>
<br>
12. Brightness controls work whether the eeepc-acpi-scripts are installed or not.<br>
<br>
Most of these items probably apply to the EEE PC 1000 HA, as it is identical to the 904 HA except for screen size (the internals of the 904 HA are actually stamped 1000 HA).<br>
<br>
I have not resolved the video mode issue at boot. If any one has any thoughts on that or the eeepc-acpi-scripts issue, please let me know.<br>
<br>
***edit*** the video issue is from the default vga=791 in the grub menu entry. The 904's screen is only 1024x600. Changing the entry in menu.lst to vga=788 solved the hangup. Now boot up is pretty quick.<br>
<br>
Antix looks gorgeous on the small screen by the way. Wonderful job!</div>
