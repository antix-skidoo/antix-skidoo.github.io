<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>but it doesn't look promising.</div></blockquote>
I have more faith in my kids and grandkids who I instilled a lust for life like I was instilled with by my parents.<br>
<br>
I figure their generation will eventually undo what the baby boomers like me have done to the USA. The rest of the worlds younger generation needs to step up also and tell their elders to go to hell also.<br>
<br>
Nothing worse than a reformed hippy. A reformed anything, like a smoker. A closet gay enacting anti gay laws (J. Edgar Hoover). Hopefully the old gaurd will die off. The new boss will not be the same as the old boss, (but history shows it likes to repeat itself). <br>
<br>
Greed is a state of mind as old as prostitution. So I do not see it going away any time time soon. The trick is to survive in such a environment. I seem to do OK. <br>
Others seem to have trouble. Sorry to hear that.<br>

<div class="content">Gee whiz, Alanarchy, I'm in the wrong country to watch Queen champion the world, but I'm glad things are working out the way you want. We don't get much about-face action from our politicians, especially not publicly. I admire your optimism and confidence about working change. I felt that way protesting Vietnam and smoking more than my fair share. We almost won. Then we bought in and sold out too. I've lost count of how many inappropriate, not-really wars we've fought. Fortunately, there's no further need to count, because now we have a war on terrorism that can last forever! How clever is that? As we're fond of saying over here - is this a great country or what?</div>

<div class="content">We are not terrorist!<br>
And the group laid it down for CNN while the press addressed the case that white terrorists with a right feeling occupied a building so:<br>
Not terrorists, but the area of the national park is freed from the tyranny, where the stockbreeders, miners, lumbermen would like to be readmited.<br>
<br>
According to them the only solution, a tax is not paid if they declare themselves independent, and federal supervision is evaded. As Ammon Bundy composed: if he is needed until years we carry on, and here we are left over.<br>
Talks about this anyway among other things one, YouTube videodividing too got on uptake one of the members of the militia of Oregon, Jon Ritzheimer. Than says it, battles against the tyranny until the death if he is needed. <br>
<br>
<br>
The oppression and the tyranny opened his head in Oregon – as we see it, on the area of all United State – and Bundy only an example was a farm. And we, citizens have to be engaged in an eye with this – the man announces it. Ritzheimer criticizes the American legal system then. Underscores it then: I renounce my life in order that I should protect this country from the tyranny in a full measure!</div>

<div class="content">It is important to recognize opinion in every sense. It is important to realize that all positions misrepresent the"facts" as"proof" and"justification." That said, there are truths: the wealth and power gap has grown to unacceptable proportions and many people have grown so upset and frustrated by the situation that the chance of volatile reactions is inevitable. Be grateful when matters simmer at the level of outraged discourse and demonstration drama. Try to defuse rather than inflame. Solutions seldom keep up with the pace of problems, and patience is necessary to avoid destruction, which is never a short-term improvement. Make certain that you personally have done everything you possibly can on a peaceful platform before you call to arms.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>There is strong evidence that the right to data protection could be undermined by the TTIP agreement by creating loopholes for companies abroad to gain access to personal data that would otherwise have to stay within European borders and thus be under the jurisdiction of European data protection law. This should not come as a surprise. US companies like Google or Facebook make a good deal of money with the data they collect through their platforms. But data protection is a fundamental right. This means it defines the starting point for negotiations. It is fundamental to our society and so by definition non-negotiable.</div></blockquote></div>

<div class="content">Jeff LaLande has a collection of memorabilia you would enjoy, Alanarchy. Personally, I enjoy the crazed creativity we call intellectualism in the US. Any computer can calculate correctly and perform logical operations. It takes a human being to properly rationalize and dabble in insanity. Call it art or call it meaning, it's all we can actually create. All else is merely manipulation. Get with the programming! It's fun. - Eric</div>

 <div class="content">These Oregon cattle breeders also fed up with the garbage in federal politikusaikból who want to chase them in the pastures which they own nearly two hundred years ago, citing belongings turtle habitats, national park they want to deliver the pastures (later listed discard: dogs-thirtieth) and those who resist lecsukatják.Ezek people took up arms, and if you have to sacrifice their lives for their family's future secure,<br>
the founding fathers refer to the Declaration of Independence and, by the way, they are absolutely true! No one party has been considered and none of the politicians, only themselves. They bought themselves a federal building with automatic weapons and will not tágítanak until the truth of their freedom and their effect can not be obtained. I beg all of you to watch this video and read the articles. These people are honest truth! Needless to say, if America itself would have to deal with it, it would be time to mess with n em all over the world, and so the people would be better off working there !!<br>
<br>
I wish the Oregon cattle breeders strength and endurance of the right fight for health!<br>

<div class="content"><strong>FAQ: Investment Court System</strong><br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1) What are TTIP and CETA?<br>
<br>
The Transatlantic Trade and Partnership Agreement (TTIP) between the US and the EU, and of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the EU are trade agreements that are being negotiated right now.<br>
<br>
The aim is to increase trade but all the benefits are for corporations and the risks are for citizens. Nothing is signed yet so we still have time to act to protect our rights. Learn more about TTIP and CETA

<br>
<br>
2) Why would businesses be allowed to sue European states and claim public money?<br>
<br>
The European Commission (EC) is working on various trade agreements between the EU and other parts of the world.<br>
<br>
The EC is so keen on the trading idea that it is ready to be very flexible - flexible to the point of giving up the right of EU countries to make decisions in the public interest. The EC is proposing a system of special private courts* that foreign** businesses can resort to to sue EU countries if their investments there didn’t yield the expected profits, and if they consider this was a result of public policies excessively protecting Europeans and the environment.<br>
<br>
* The technical name is Investor - State Dispute Mechanism or ISDS<br>
<br>
** US and Canadian in the above cases<br>
<br>
3) What is the difference between ISDS and ICS?<br>
<br>
According to a wide array of trade experts in European civil society [ref], very little. Following much uproar from Europeans, the Investor - State Dispute Mechanism (ISDS) was replaced with the Investment Court System (ICS) last September. The core problem with this ICS proposal is that it still contains the idea of a judiciary system that is parallel to our public courts system, and that is only available to some people: foreign investors and businesses.<br>
<br>
The Commission argues that in these special courts there’ll be some transparency in cases brought by businesses against EU countries, and that ‘judges’ will be ‘of public career’. However, the prospect of being able to scrutinize cases is of little relief because we know such ‘judges’ will be private lawyers that will be paid by the litigating party (i.e. the big foreign business).<br>
<br>
If these “judges” are paid by the big corporations every time they work on a case it is in their interest to run as many cases as possible. That's exactly what differentiates an independent court from a biased one.<br>
<br>
4) Who in the European Union is being consulted on this?<br>
<br>
In September 2015 EU countries were asked by the European Commission to position themselves on the ‘new’ proposal for special private courts. The European Parliament is also consulted. Also, in 2014, the Commission ran a public consultation: nearly 150,000 Europeans filled it in, 97% of which rejected any kind of special court of foreign businesses, whether it’s called ISDS or ICS.<br>
<br>
5) €30 billion have already been claimed from EU countries by corporations? What does this mean?<br>
<br>
Until October 2015, investors and businesses have already claimed at least 30 billion Euros in compensation from EU countries through special private courts (technically called ISDS mechanisms). EU governments have already been forced to pay out upwards of €3.5 billion, with the rest being still unclear as the cases are yet to be concluded.<br>
<br>
These claims have been possible because ISDS courts were included in other trade treaties the EU signed up to in the past. The inclusion of ISDS in TTIP, CETA and other upcoming trade treaties will increase the amount of cases brought by businesses against EU countries, as well as the quantity of the claims, with EU taxpayers footing the bill.</div></blockquote></div>

<div class="content">It's tempting to blame the folks at the top, and they are certainly not blameless. However, we should remember that the US is in fact still run by We the People. We don't vote at the ballet box as much as we should. We do vote at the cash register much more than we should. Consumerism drives capitalism in this country. The CEO's, politicians, bankers, etc. just guide this populace toward private profit rather than public good. What rules America is greed at all levels.</div>
