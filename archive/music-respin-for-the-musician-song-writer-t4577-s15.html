<div class="content">Part of the Please_Read_Me file<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Audio on the Motherboard<br>
These chips typically offer basic, digital audio recording/playback of the quality of a typical"game card". Besides having a DAC and ADC so that you can record and play digital audio (and play game sound effects and voice), these chips also tend to have at least support for a Software Synth for MIDI playback. A good chip should even support MIDI IN and OUT through a MIDI Adapter attached to a joystick port. But in notebooks without a joystick port, you typically have to get an external MIDI Interface for MIDI support beyond a Software Synth.<br>
Personally, I don't like motherboard audio because you can't upgrade it easily. If you want to buy and install a new audio card, you can't remove that chip. Therefore you have to setup your new card such that it doesn't conflict with the settings of that onboard chip. Typically, the computer's BIOS has settings to disable the onboard chip, but besides being a waste (ie, at least you can sell an old audio card when you buy a new one, or reuse it in another computer -- (not so with these embedded chips), I've discovered that PnP issues and other BIOS bugs can result in problems. Sometimes you can't get that onboard chip to stop using valuable resources (ie, IRQ lines) that you want for your new card, or otherwise can't make it completely"disappear". It lingers like bad body odor, causing you grief.(I have not had this issue with antix, or Debian, it may be a Windows issue.) <br>
I think that an audio card is a better deal than motherboard audio, unless you're absolutely sure that you want a typical game card quality and don't ever want to upgrade for the lifetime of that motherboard. An exception to this is a notebook computer since you can't install a separate ISA or PCI soundcard, and notebooks aren't noted for their upgradability anyway.<br>
If you want top performance, an audio card that is made especially for clean digital audio such as the DAL CardD or V8, Aardvark Direct Pro 24/96, the Event Gina, Layla, or Darla, or other high-end digital audio cards,to go with your MIDI Interface, Soundblaster live,and Audigy cards are adequate, and a lot less expensive. <br>
<br>
A word on ALSA <br>
Seems that the biggest complaint with ALSA is that the sound is low on some systems. Open the ALSA mixer and mute any outputs that you don't use. Then adjust the outputs in use, to run the maximum without distortion. <br>
If your using a laptop, invest into a good set of headphones, or use external speakers. (Just face it laptops tiny speakers, even on the high end models are inadequate for listening to music.)</div></blockquote></div>

A word on ALSA <br>
Seems that the biggest complaint with ALSA is that the sound is low on some systems. Open the ALSA mixer and mute any outputs that you don't use. Then adjust the outputs in use, to run the maximum without distortion. <br>
If your running a laptop, invest into a good set of headphones, or use external speakers. <br>
<br>
Lets get started. <br>
You will notice a directory named “nted”. That is the location of the music editors saved files. The midi file in that directory,needs a run action to be set. Right click on the “sample.mid” file <br>
then select “Set Run Action “ then in box below what say's” Enter A shell command:” Type in the following : timidity -ia"$@" Then click “Use Command”. Now when you click on a .mid file the midi player will open with all the controls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Setting up NtEd (music score editor) <br>
For you to hear the notes that you put into your music, or have play back, You must first set the output from the music editor. Click on “Edit” then 'Preferences” then click on “Configure MIDI out” select one of the four timidity outputs. Then OK. I have a sample file for you to test it. Click File, Open then go to nted directory, and open the sample file. Then click on edit then click play you should hear a short tune. For more information, and instructions click on the help documentation. <br>
<br>
For the people that have more powerful computers with MIDI sound cards “jackd and Jackd2 is already installed, all you need to do is install Qjackctl to setup the sound server. Then you can setup the more resource hungry sound, and music editing software. <br>
<br>
I have my favorite toy, that is a Virtual MIDI keyboard. You can't edit your music, or do anything besides make some noise. (the children love it) <br>
I choose Clementine multiplatform music player, because it handles large music libraries the best, along with a responsive equalizer. <br>
Other software is aconnect, timidity, timidity-daemon, timidity-interfaces-extra, VLC player, Gtick Metronome, Sound Converter, Audacity sound editing tool, and Chromium Web browser. <br>
<br>
You will not find office software, or many games. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>﻿Welcome to antiX Music 64bit addition. <br>
<br>
The software selected is for the music writers, musicians, and audiophiles alike.<br>
<br>
The current setup uses a software synthesizer, so not as hardware dependent. But the software is available in this distribution, to go beyond the software synthesizer. <br>
<br>
Audio on the Motherboard<br>
These chips typically offer basic, digital audio recording/playback of the quality of a typical"game card". Besides having a DAC and ADC so that you can record and play digital audio (and play game sound effects and voice), these chips also tend to have at least support for MIDI playback. A good chip should even support MIDI IN and OUT through a MIDI Adapter attached to a joystick port. But in notebooks without a joystick port, you typically have to get an external MIDI Interface for MIDI support beyond a Software Synthesizer.<br>
Personally, I don't like motherboard audio because you can't upgrade it easily. If you want to buy and install a new audio card, you can't remove that chip. Therefore you have to setup your new card such that it doesn't conflict with the settings of that onboard chip. Typically, the computer's BIOS has settings to disable the onboard chip, but besides being a waste (ie, at least you can sell an old audio card when you buy a new one, or reuse it in another computer -- (not so with these embedded chips), I've discovered that PnP issues and other BIOS bugs can result in problems. Sometimes you can't get that onboard chip to stop using valuable resources (ie, IRQ lines) that you want for your new card, or otherwise can't make it completely"disappear". It lingers like bad body odor, causing you grief.(I have not had this issue with antix, or Debian, it may be a Windows issue.) <br>
I think that an audio card is a better deal than motherboard audio, unless you're absolutely sure that you want a typical game card quality and don't ever want to upgrade for the lifetime of that motherboard. An exception to this is a notebook computer since you can't install a separate ISA or PCI soundcard, and notebooks aren't noted for their upgradability anyway.<br>
If you want top performance, an audio card that is made especially for clean digital audio such as the DAL CardD or V8, Aardvark Direct Pro 24/96, the Event Gina, Layla, or Darla, or other high-end digital audio cards,to go with your MIDI Interface, Soundblaster live,and Audigy cards are adequate, and a lot less expensive. <br>

If your using a laptop, invest into a good set of headphones, or use external speakers. (Just face it laptops tiny speakers, even on the high end models are inadequate for listening to music.)<br>

Click File, Open then go to nted directory, and open the sample file. Then click on"Edit" then click"Play" you should hear a short tune. Next click “File” then"Export MIDI" Then save it. <br>
Now you have a Midi file in nted directory. The midi file in that directory,needs a run action to be set. Right click on the “sample.mid” file then select “Set Run Action “ then in box below what say's” Enter A shell command:” Type in the following : timidity -ia"$@" Then click “Use Command”.

<div class="content">I have given the 64 bit version a quick trial in Virtualbox, running live.<br>
Seems to be working ok. Nice wallpapers as well!<br>
<br>
Since you do not have libreoffice installed, you should remove the write desktop icon (spacefm and rox).<br>
Also, how about removing some apps that are not really geared towards a music distro so that it fits on a cd? <br>
<br>
Good job Eino.</div>

Thanks for the compliment, IT's still a work in progress. I'm currently making a list of stuff to remove.</div>
