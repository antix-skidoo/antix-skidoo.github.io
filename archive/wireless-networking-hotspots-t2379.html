<div class="content">One of the things I got curious about once I actually started using laptops with wireless network access is not just grabbing a Linksys or Belkin router and walking around the house, but also carrying the laptop with me. I've posted from Border's Bookstore, Staple's Hotspot, and maybe Starbucks once or twice. But recently I read an advertisement that says that you can use McDonald's Wifi spots whether you are purchasing anything or not. I may actually get a drink; I am thirsty, but they advertise an open and free network.<br>
<br>
I am actually using it and I have not purchased anything yet. I do the same at Border's, half of the time using the Border's network and half of the time the Staple's network; they are next door to one another and they seem to use the same carrier (OK, but not particularly fast).<br>
<br>
This McDonald's connection seems halfway decent. Took a while to connect at first, but once connected, it seems pretty responsive.<br>
<br>
A tip for newcomers to wireless networking: at least in my area, if I use Yahoo or Google's search tool and feed it the string: Concord, NH Wifi Hotspot or Hooksett, NH Wifi Hotspot, it will immediately give me what I am looking for.<br>
<br>
Try it out in your area and see what you come up with. Could prove rather interesting! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">I use McDonald's connections all the time. I've been using them as ATT is my DSL provider and I get ATT hotspots indcluded (ATT runs MCDonald's Hotspots). Also, several of your lower cost motel chains have networks accessable from the parking lots...<br>

hey masinick, I've done a little construction work in Concord at the steam plant. Nice town!</div>

In ancient CB Radio lingo,"What's your"20"? I actually live in the state capital of Concord, New Hampshire, and I currently work in Hooksett, NH. Most of my jobs have been in Merrimack or Nashua, NH over the years since moving to New England. I originally hailed from Fraser, Michigan, about 20 miles from downtown Detroit. I last visited Michigan in the summer of 2008. I did take I-75 through the main city of Detroit on the way home; that's the closest I had been to Detroit in twenty years prior to that.<br>
<br>
I have contracted for financial services companies in Boston. It has been since late 2008 that I've done work around the State and Congress Street area there.</div>

<div class="content">You've definently been around. I'm down south of Toledo OH. I've bid some work in Merrimack, but I didn't get it. I've got a company I work with a bunch over in Bow. Its a small world <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

I like that steam plant in Concord. It runs on wood. I think its only one of two wood-fired plants that generate electricity left in the country.</div>

Cool! Next time you come to NH let me know. Can't promise anything for certain, but it sure would be nice to get a chance to actually meet a fellow antiX user and fan! We may even go to an AT&amp;T Hotspot and try out antiX there and see if anyone is on the forum and we could have a quick chat using the message feature at the top! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
