<div class="content">I was reading dedoimedo and he pointed out something interesting that i've never see before downloading a distro. It's something about exporting fedora. Here's what it says on fedora's download page.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Export Regulations<br>
<br>
By clicking on and downloading Fedora, you agree to comply with the following terms and conditions:<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora"<br>linktext was:"https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Doesn't that kind of go against the whole free software stuff? I was unaware that one from a certain country couldn't download something if their government is hated by the US gpovernment. Maybe someone could explain, as this is the first time I've ever seen it<br>
<br>
Anyways, who would use fedora OS to develop WMD's? Fedora isway too broke and nstable to do any type of meaningful work, imo.</div>

<div class="content">When I first started using Linux. I tried Open-Suse 9 and Mandriva 10 (I think, it,s been awhile)<br>
<br>
RPM hell was what I ended up with in Mandriva using their urmpi repositories back then which cured me of rpm distros since then. I have not looked back since. I did not know about what you posted either buttcoffee. Times are getting more paranoid I guess.</div>

<div class="content">That's USA law. I live in Brazil and don't need to comply with that, i.e., I can download Fedora and send it to whatever country I like.<br>
* actually, since that's just a 'human', arbitrary, law, it's liable to questionings even in USA.</div>

<div class="content">i'm wondering how it's even enforceable. I've never seen any of the other distros mention those kinds of terms. <br>
<br>
One thing about the distros that use rpm is it never became clear to me if one could use rpm's for fedora on something like opensuse or mandriva. I guess i'll never know because I don't plan on using any of them anytime soon.</div>
