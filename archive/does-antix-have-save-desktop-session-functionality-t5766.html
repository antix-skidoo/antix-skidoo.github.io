<div class="content">Hi All,<br>
<br>
I've been Googling and forum searching for antiX desktop-session save and haven't found anything. What caused me to think about this is that I have a bunch of apps open trying to figure out some more key bindings as per a previous post and I'd love to be able to turn this old laptop off at night to let it cool down, but I don't want to shutdown and then have to find all these apps and files again. I can't find that antiX has this functionality, it appears MX does which is also a great OS but runs a little warmer on this old laptop?</div>

<div class="content">Not in the way you are thinking. MX uses XFCE which includes a full session manager. antiX and its host of window managers does not have a session manager that saves the running apps. If there is a set of apps you want to have start every boot, you can add them to the desktop-session startup file, available in the control center.</div>

<div class="content">As soon as it is figured on how the window managers layout their"sessions" and if it can be made light enough it will probably come around in the future of desktop-session. At the moment the base system needs some more sorting. If anyone would like to look into a way to see what apps are running and what they have open (so that they can be closed and reopened), they are more than welcome to post details of this. At the moment the best thing on note is being able to find what is opened and on what workspace... so at the least we could work it in to start apps and send them to the workspace they were before but it is by no means where you were before shutting down. Also to note it would be very likely to be quirky, where some things might not be saved and others not started in the proper manner.</div>

Dave, I think that you are right about this. A good, full-featured desktop environment is capable of doing all of these things, but they involve not only communications overhead, configuration, but they also tend to impact startup speed. These features are not widely available unless you use a desktop manager for that purpose.<br>
<br>
When I want to have these kinds of features available to me, I install and use Xfce, an increasingly popular desktop system that is a very nice compromise between a super filled desktop like KDE and a light, window manager-based system, like IceWM, Fluxbox, or fvwm. Xfce provides the ways to save session information, but still starts up in a modest configuration just over 100 MB - usually in the 110-120 MB range at startup. The metapackage installer and smxi both provide ways to install a basic Xfce configuration with antiX.</div>
