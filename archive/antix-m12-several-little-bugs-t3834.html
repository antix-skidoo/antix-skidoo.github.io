<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I am not new to Linux, but a bit new to antiX. I just posted, and it took me some time, but the forums have decided to invalidate my session, so I lost my post when I hit submit. <br>
<br>
The machine used : laptop Omnibook 6000 PIII 800 Mhz - 192 MB ram.<br>
<br>
Here is a pic:<br>

I would like to reconfigure it, so to get the contextual menu of the desktop being displayed only when I right-click on the desktop : how can I do that ?<br>
<br>
<br>

2)     system-antix   </code></pre></div>
I would like it not to pull out the two above items. I don't know what"system-antix" contains, but for antix-cc I must say I like it very much. At same time, Gparted is really not useful in that one machine.<br>
<br>
I think it the list of depends for Gparted there are a few which could preferably be removed, which generally come along. (libparted0debian1, libgtkmm-2.4-1c2a)<br>

I will address the"bug" you have described.<br>
This little window is actually caused by the volume icon not being fully loaded. I have installed antiX-12 on several laptops and the fix requires a bit of fiddling with the home/~/.icewm/startup script. You can easily modify this by using the antixcc and Edit IceWM settings.<br>
At the bottom of the script are these 3 lines. You may not have the 3rd line in your script.
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>(sleep 3 &amp;&amp; volumeicon) &amp;
(sleep 5 &amp;&amp; toram-eject) &amp;
(sleep 5 &amp;&amp; sudo persist-config --startup) &amp;
</code></pre></div>
What you need to do is change the delay on the volumeicon line to
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>(sleep 5 &amp;&amp; volumeicon) &amp;
(sleep 5 &amp;&amp; toram-eject) &amp;
(sleep 5 &amp;&amp; sudo persist-config --startup) &amp;
</code></pre></div>
You may have to experiment a bit with different settings. I believe I had to set the volumeicon delay to 7 on one of the machines I installed on.<br>
Finally, if I recall correctly, I could always log out/log in and the little window would disappear, even in a live session.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you male, and afa4 ! For grub, I have already edited the menu.lst, but I would remember for next time, that a simple"update-grub" as root will do the trick. For the fiddling with the icewm config, I'll do that tomorrow, and hopefully it will solve it. I hope the other little annoyances will also get sooner or later a solution.<br>
<br>
(And within a few days I will have to come talk about how it goes in another machine... and perhaps I'll play the install again once before).</div>

<div class="content">Bad bug2 is not an antiX bug as far as I can tell (we ship with iceweasel), unless you mean that midori crashes only in antiX and not Debian testing (on which it is based).<br>
<br>
Little bug 3 - is a feature! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> The first entry is set via the installer, the other two, after an update-grub is triggered on first installed boot so that grub is configured correctly.<br>
<br>
Little bug 5 is a Debian bug that is 'fixed' in Sid/unstable. It is completely harmless.</div>

<div class="content">Hello anticapitalista,<br>
<br>
First thing, I want to tell you I found your recent versions (RC2 and final which I tested and used just these days) mega brilliant ! It is a fantastic tool ! And even if you already know it, I want you to know that I find it great ! With this post a list of little bugs, I mainly want to bring a modest contribution, while eventually solving one or two that are bothering me a bit.<br>
<br>
About Midori, I will ask people using Debian testing, because I am mainly an Archlinux user, and at Archlinux (my box is a 64bits) I have no problem using it whatsoever.<br>
<br>
This makes me think : what version of Midori is available in antiX ? Aha ! after a"apt-cache show":<br>
<span style="color: #000080">version is 0.4.3-1.</span><br>
<br>
In Archlinux, a"pacman -Si midori" tells me:<br>
<span style="color: #000080">Version : 0.4.6-2</span><br>
<br>
Could we fancy that the newer version (without illegal instructions) could be compiled and packaged for antiX ? (Debian does not have newer than 0.4.3, even in unstable). (I don't offer to do it, because the first and only package I did took me not less than one week : packaged"
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://code.google.com/p/mimarchlinux/wiki/OpenBoxMenu"<br>linktext was:"openbox-menu"<br>====================================<br>
" for Debian, then for PPA Ubuntu).<br>
<br>
About feature"little bug # 3" : I would like to ask what"nouveau.modeset=0" does in the system ? This would allow me to know if I can reduce the number of entries. ie: if this is a tweak dedicated to nvidia gpus, this machine having an ATI Rage3 it will not be necessary. I didn't find any other difference with entry number 2, as the first one is also for the same smp i486 kernel.<br>
<br>
I have found another little bug, which I would like to solve, I'll add it as #6 is the list of the first post. It is related to keyboard shortcuts, F10 triggers the desktop contextual menu, even when the console containing mc is selected, so that after I have changed the console configuration to be able to use F10 to quit mc, the desktop contextual menu appear just besides, unexpectedly.</div>

<div class="content">melodie - thanks for the comments and yes I do see your bug list as a positive contribution to improving antiX.<br>
<br>
For midori I would prefer not to package the latest, which means users will just have to wait for it to enter Testing. The reason being that I want antiX to be totally compatible with Debian Testing and not add/remove any necessary libraries for a later version of an application. It *might* break at some point, not just the app itself, but maybe other things as well.<br>

<div class="content">Someone told me it could be a matter of flags present on the machine of the packager and not present in the machine which I am using now. He also added that it could come from webkit rather than from midori. <br>
<br>
So I went to wikipedia to seek for other browsers using webkit, and available at Debian. I found uzbl, which crashed. the Wikipedia page also mentioned Chromium. I installed it, and I am now using it : does it use webkit ? It does not seem to crash.<br>
<br>

I have asked some Debian users, one told me it works. Another one tested in vbox and told me it works (but the test was too short, here if I don't do anything in the browser it can stay still a few seconds). And one tested in Crunchbang in vbox and said it works.<br>
<br>
I tried to find out what compilation flags were used in the webkit version which is available at antiX but could not find out. <br>
<br>
I still hope these few elements can help debug (ie: the proc here does not have sse2 in the flags).<br>
<br>
Thank you for the <strong>nouveau.modeset=0</strong> information.</div>

I am posting from within Midori. The problem was coming from flashplugin-nonfree. I'll be back from within the other machine from where I was logged in"ssh -X", to show the gdb output.<br>

after that, I did a"aptitude purge flashplugin-nonfree" and I was able to use Midori normally to come post here. Great find ! Thanks again to captnfab who gave me the idea to use gdb, I had not think about it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, <br>
<br>
I marked solved several in the list and added 2. I didn't solve the button bug yet, although I have tried several sleep times for volumeicon : is it sure that it is volumeicon which is concerned ? The button is related to displaying all windows, so it seems a bit strange that it would be triggered by a volumeicon icon being slow to start ?<br>
<br>
I will comment out volumeicon in the startup script to see what happens then.</div>

<div class="content">hi,<br>
bug 1: if volume icon doesn't make the window, sometimes i suspect that wicd makes this ghost window.<br>
bug 4: you could use smxi to install kernels. it will install the kernel, headers, update grub and i think it installs gcc also.<br>
bug 6: edit your keys setting from control center for icewm or fluxbox depending on what you are using.<br>
bug 7: gparted is a dependency of antix-cc so i see the reason it wants to remove both of them. if you want free space deleting gparted won't give you lots of it. here is what i use to get more space on my installs: post18498.html#p18498</div>

I will try your fix for #6, and for #7 it's not for space, there is enough, but for the program itself. I try to reduce the number of programs which are not needed in that box. The menus are very full of programs not needed (I would not have dared start with a basis version because I don't know the distro enough yet, to ensure getting a result at least as good).<br>
<br>
By reporting it here I thought it would be a good idea to suggest a different tree dependency for Gparted.<br>
<br>
I have commented volumeicon and the ghost window was not there anymore. I uncommented it, put 7 seconds, then it's not there but the screen flickers several times before staying still. I will try to look into the .xsession-errors file next. <br>
<br>
n# 5 : I don't know the tool you are saying about. I will not change the kernel anymore, and for future uses on other machines I know the trick now. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

Thanks for your answers.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Here is the content of the .xsession-errors after just logged in : 
<br>
The only warning I know I can fix it the shortcut for Midori. Do you have suggests to fix the other warnings/error messages ?<br>

Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Bug number 1 is solved ! and not by adding seconds to the volumeicon, but something else. <br>
<br>
First, thanks to someone at the irc.freenode.net #icewm chan who has known at once where the trouble was coming from. Here an extract of our discussion (with his kind permission):<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>&lt;mythos&gt; melodie_, sorry, which window appears?<br>
&lt;melodie_&gt; hi mythos in the pic, the very little thingy on the top left of the screen<br>
&lt;melodie_&gt; just at the left of the htop window<br>
&lt;mythos&gt; melodie_, is that a trayicon? do you have startet icewmtray (or was it icetray)?<br>
&lt;mythos&gt; *have you started<br>
&lt;melodie_&gt; it's not icewmtray<br>
&lt;melodie_&gt; it's a full mystery<br>
&lt;mythos&gt; no, i mean, icewmtray handles the trayicon-area for icewm. if that prozess does not run, many programs draw a seperate window for only this icon.</div></blockquote>
So what I did is re-open the file ~/.icewm/startup and I noticed the icewmtray is commented. I commented out and go !<br>
<br>
Here is the startup script of mine now:<br>

<br>
I have commented out wicd because it is not and will not be used, but this is a detail which is not related to the problem. <br>
<br>
The volumeicon sleep time to wait is 3 as before, as you can see. I have shutdown and even unplugged from power source twice before booting agin since, to be sure, and the ghost window didn't re appear. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Good catch there melodie!<br>
<br>
You know, I must have commented out icewmtray for a reason, but for the life of me cannot remember why.<br>
<br>
I'll add this to the bug fix.<br>
<br>
thanks</div>
