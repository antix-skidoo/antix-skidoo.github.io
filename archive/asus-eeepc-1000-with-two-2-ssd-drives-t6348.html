<div class="content">Hello.<br>
<br>
I have an old (2009) Asus EeePC-1000 netbook computer which originally shipped with a modified Xandros operating system. This computer has two SSD drives installed: an 8 GB (sda) one which is designed to handle the actual operating system and another <br>
32 GB (sdb) one which is supposed to handle whatever is stored (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc.)<br>
<br>
When I first got it, using that Xandros OS, both drives booted up by default. (It wasn't until somewhat later that I even knew there were actually two drives; they advertised it as a 40 GB hard drive computer.)<br>
<br>
The Xandros OS being no longer supported, I needed to install another OS. I picked Lubuntu; this was in 2012. I installed it to the 8 GB drive and there was a program called pysdm which allowed me to manually mount and access the second drive on which I placed my Documents, etc.<br>
<br>
When 2014 and version 14.04 came around, the psydm program was no longer available. So I 'wiped' the computer (using DBAN) and installed Lubuntu 14.04 to the second (sdb) drive, ignoring altogether the sda drive. That worked well.<br>
<br>
Recently, the new version being available, I again 'wiped' the computer and attempted to install Lubuntu 16.04 [32-bit edition] onto that sdb drive.<br>
<br>
This time, the whole thing failed - I got an error message (a 'fatal error' one) that said that the installer could not install GRUB - and then it froze (and I mean froze!) the entire computer. I was forced to 'wipe' it again.<br>
<br>
I tried installing antiX 15.1 to the sda drive and, using GParted, I formatted the sdb drive (to ext4).<br>
<br>
However, I could not find any way to access that drive and, of course, I could not put any Documents, etc. onto it.<br>
<br>
Plus the WiFi didn't work though that might have been due to my attempting to modify the OS to allow access to the sdb drive and to my 'playing' around with other things. (I am especially not proficient with GParted.)<br>
<br>
Again I 'wiped' the computer.<br>
<br>
So there we are - I have a nice, physically robust, computer with no operating system installed.<br>
<br>
I would really hate to give it away or throw it out.<br>
<br>
Can anyone tell me (and I'm afraid I'll need step-by-step instructions) how to<br>
<br>
a) install antiX [either 15.1 or antiX-16-b2.1-full] to the sda drive and<br>
<br>
b) make the sdb SSD drive boot by default along with the sda drive (or at least have some easy method of manually mounting and accessing that sdb drive and copying all my data to it)?<br>
<br>
Please note that I am fairly proficient with a computer but I am not a 'computer genius' by any means. I CAN follow instructions if they are clear and comprehensive however.<br>
<br>
I apologize for this long post but I will sincerely thank anyone who can help me.</div>

Howdy and welcome to AntiX. Though my how to's may give you a idea. If any problems because AntiX has changed a bit since I wrote those how tos. Just hollar back into this thread with screenshots with a good description on what is hard to understand and maybe one of the other members can sort you out.<br>
<br>
I have been busy with out door projects outside of linux. So I am just in and out of here on a short basis. So the waits on me showing up will put cob webs under your armpits. <br>

Edit: wifi whould work out of the box. Post a <br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>inxi -F</code></pre></div>
in your next post so members can see your system. Reading my how tos. I try and make them as easy to understand as possible. So inxi is in my how tos also. inxi is already installed in AntiX live.<br>

<div class="content">Well, I carefully read and followed your instructions and while antiX-16-b2.1-full installed and the computer appeared to have both drives mounted, I had no cursor. Only after I entered Ctrl-C and used the Tab button to get to and open Synaptic did a cursor appear. I followed the first two of your Terminal commands but, even using su, the third command (cp -rp /home/user /media/sdb1) didn't work at all. And I couldn't even find the fstab folder. And again, the wireless didn't work (yes I made certain that it was activated in the BIOS).<br>
<br>
So, after spending another hour-and-a-half with this computer, I'm just going to give up. It's just not worth my time any more.<br>
<br>
But I do thank you for trying. Your directions were very clear; it may be possible that some may need updating but I was able to install the OS to the computer with both drives mounting automatically. It's just that the computer itself is just not functioning properly (apparently).<br>
<br>
Thanks again.</div>

we have identified a problem in 16-b2 that leaves many intel based notebooks, including those in the netbook class, without a mouse cursor at login. its actually there, but invisibile. we are working on it.<br>
<br>
btw, fstab is a file, not a folder. its a text file in the <em>/</em>etc folder.</div>

<div class="content">THANK YOU! As I'm writing this, I'm 'wiping' that computer with DBAN (again!). I may try to run antiX-15 from the disk to see if I can get the WiFi to work. If not, it's (probably) off to Goodwill with it (that's if they would want it)!</div>
