<br>
<br>
If I had waited till this week t order it. I would have saved $9.00 in shipping. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
Oh. Well. Glad I got it so far. Came with Windows XP (recovery disk also) and specs are in link above. Sorry. I don't think they do free shipping to Europe or Asia.<br>
<br>
Screen is abut as big as a IPAD I guess. I tried booting into XP and download Avast Anti Virus. I didn't know the download window would close when I closed Internet Explorer. PMO it did. <br>
<br>
So I grabbed my Puppeee 4 gig External Flash Drive I had in my Laptop Bag. Inserted in this 701sd and it loaded fine. Correct screen resution. Wireless to. Hotkeys and Camera and Sound . Better than Windows and I got Firefox 4.3 with update capabilty with Google-Chrome also. Screeny is just of Favorites Menu.<br>
<br>
Gonna be making another AntiX 8.5 persistent USB for this thing. Aint gonna wipe windows off internal drive till I look int what is n that recovery CD. It says on a Label.<br>
701 SD XP. But on the disk itself it says Asus Driver Disk which tells me that it is just the drivers for Windows XP for this Laptop. Not Windows itself. Maybe I can dd Windows to a External 8gig SD card since internal SSD drive is 8 gig also. Man. I got a lot to learn yet on how to make a recovery XP USB of some sort. I figure I paid for Windows. Might as well keep it. Hell. Windows XP here in the states was the price f this Netbook not s ng ago.<br>

Yeah. I know I need to upgrade inxi. I had this card put away for awhile. Jemimah installed GL and glxgears for Graphics in the kernel. I think that is why inxi isn't picking up Graphics in readout. Just a guess though. All Puppys react to inxi in this way. Same Same for Network readout.<br>

Like I said. All Puppy distros do this. I have a choice of Rox with Icewm or Netbook with Icewm or PCMAN Desktop with Icewm. Screeny is of Netbook Desktop.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So far with what little time I have spent on this Netbook. Puppeee works right out of the box so far.<br>
Can't wait to see how my persistentantiX2usb goes with this Netbook. Details to follow later during the week. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>

<div class="content">Damn. I thought I edited and deleted the top screenshot. All thumbs lately I guess, Now don't pay atterntion to the Biker behind the curtain, This post is just for notes while I make my antix2usb on Kingston 8gig SD Flash drive. My first mistake. I suffer from CRS so I made some errors because I don't do this every day. @nd mistake was trying to do this on my AntiX 8.5 Full Iso install on my IBM M41 which probably has a failing hardrive (but I don't know if that is the cause for sure)<br>
<br>
What I did so far. Grabbed my new Antix 8.5 Update Full Iso from my external 250 gig IDE Hardrive and transfer to 2 gig pendrive (copy and paste). Then plugged it into my IBM M41 Desktop. Had to unplug USB WIFI as USB WIFI covers other usb socket. OK. Cut and Paste to antixnewiso folder in /home. Doh&gt; I had to rename folder cuz it used to say antix new iso, didn't like spaces when using antix2usb in antixcc. Like I said. I am tripping over my feet today. Too much multi tasking and I sux at multi tasking.<br>
<br>
On with the story. All preceding errors attributed to Code 18 <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> .<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Doh. Forgot to unmount drive. Stumbling right along. I decide to open gparted and format card as ext2 file system (I had left it as fat32 and thought the error was related to that) wrong!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So now I have a 8gig card formatted as ext2 file system. Read up on my blog on how I did this the last time. Oh yeah rokytnji. <strong>UNmount the drive!</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So. It starts to look like things are preceding nicely. I type into terminal (feeling cocky now. Humming Girs Doom song from Invader Zim cartoon)"looking good said by biker"<br>
What a kid I am and me being a grandad. Well this was what I got for being so durn cocky.<br>

may be due to my failing hardrive on this desktop (guessing here). So I will use my Asus eeepc 900 instead to make a antix2usb persistent 8gig flash drive. Will have to do it later as I get into enough hot water with the wife when she sees me too much on the computer instead of doing honey does. I'd post some other screenshots in this post but forum only allows 3 attatchment maxixmum. So next post is to show what gparted showed after errors. Looks like some short comings in /data. I am just posting all this so if anybody on the net screws the pooch as bad as me. This is what it looks like. This post is on how not to do antix2usb and what mistakes look like.</div>

Ok. Posting this running live AntiX 8.5 Update Iso. Made with Unetbootin (works for me)<br>
I coulda done this on my Asus EEEpc 701SD. But I figured I already had my Asus EEEPc 900 <br>
broke out already. So I used it instead, Besides. My next post should hopefully be me booting up my<br>
newly made antix2usb persistent 8gig sd external flash drive so I can report how things turned out.<br>
<br>
Now. Scenario. I have one 2gig Kingston Data Traveler pendrive holding AntiX 8.5 Update Iso plugged in to usb.<br>
I have one 4gig Sandisk Cruzer (with U3 software removed using Sandisks website U3 WINDOWS ONLY<br>
removal tool) running a live Usb of Antix 8.5 Update Iso made with Unetbootin.<br>
I have one 8 gig Dana Electric External SD Flash Card in my card reader.<br>
<br>
Clear as mud to a newbie. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
Ok. I cut and paste my AntiX 8.5 from 2 gig USB drive over to /demo folder in Live USB. Just open file manager to see what I mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is gonna take up 2 posts because I will exceed forum screenshot limits again in this post.<br>
Any Hows. Just like in above screenshots in above posts I run the antix2usb again from control center.<br>
Below screen shots and text readout from terminal <strong>shows how a succesful made persistent flash drive install should look like</strong><br>

Oh Boy. The Wifey Just got home. She does not know about the Asus 701SD yet (she gripes that I have to many laptops) so you will have to wait till she goes to bed before I can break out the 701SD and post my results. <br>

<br>
Took me all @#%* day but I finally got er done. Windows fought me all day but Linux finally prevailed.<br>
<br>
I have been wanting to dd the Windows Xp install on internal drive to my External 8 gig SD Flash Drive.<br>
First. I formatted 8 gig card as NTFS using Gparted in Puppeee. Booted into Windows to check on drive.<br>
Opened Disk Management in Windows. Windows does not recognize the file system. Calls it RAW.<br>
<span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> So. I hafta download and use the HP Format Tool <br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Hard-Disk-Utils/HP-USB-Disk-Storage-Format-Tool.shtml"<br>linktext was:"http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Har ... Tool.shtml"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
I format the drive in Windows using that tool. What is slowing me down that this takes all day. Windows Updates. Rebooting 5 times. Slow performance on this Netbook running XP (this is pretty much a fresh <br>
unmodified Factory Install of XP that runs slow as a snail on this Phison internal 8 gig SSD).<br>
<br>
So after triple, quadruple checking everything in Disk Management because I don't want Windows to have a hissy fit when I try to boot of the external SD Flash drive. I insert my Puppeee external flash drive. I open up PUDD in Puppeee. It tells me the flash drive is too small by a few mb. So I open Gparted again and shrink the internal Windows Partition to fit the external 8 gig SD Fash Drive.<br>
<br>
Of course, I gotta boot into Windows again to make sure it still works after shrinking the internal partition on internal drive Good thing I did this because Windows ran a check disk before it would reboot. Waiting. Waiting.<br>
Boot into XP. What. More Updates. More lost time. More reboots. Windows is afeared (maybe it knows what I<br>
am up to, who knows) Finally got everything sorted. Boot back into Puppeee. Now before any body mentions <br>
that I can dd from terminal in command line. I have never done anything like this before. Besides. PUDD is just a GUI for DD use. It Still opens a terminal at the end after the warnings"are you sure".<br>
<br>
Because this is being done via a external Flash drive. It took a while to do. But finished successfully. <br>
I shutdown. Pull Puppeee. Select Boot 8gig External SD Flash Drive. It loads XP and runs almost as fast (not quite though) as it did on the internal 8gig Phison SSD drive. I made this backup. In Case I ever want to resell this 701SD or need Windows for whatever reason (tuning motorcycles is one reason). Besides. I paid for this.<br>
<br>
Now. Later this week. I am going to blow away XP on this internal Drive now that I have a backup.<br>
<br>
<br>
I can now do a internal Full AntiX 8.5 install instead of Frugal. <br>
<br>
I am doing all this so I can make this Asus EEEPC 701SD a testbed for one of my Favorite Distros. You guys <br>
know I will document my adventures doing all this. Hopefully it will pull more users into AntiX from the EEEPC world.<br>
<br>
Git er Done, Rok <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

<span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>EDIT</strong></span> I should mention. I used the 8gig External antix2usb persistent drive to make my backup of XP. Wiped AntiX and used it.<br>
<br>
I now run antix2usb persistent on a 4gig External Kingston SD drive now.</div>
