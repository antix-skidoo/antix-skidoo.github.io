I think technology can be modify but animals, plants, air, water, should not be touch or play with, because these are our only last resources for future survival and as far as my concern those touching it, have not done things right.<br>

<br>
But I do understand your worries.</div></blockquote>Thank you very much. It is nice to know that you are vegetarian is a smart move. I congratulate you for that. I did put that info for people to read and for them to make their own possible investigations if they choose so. Myself knows the importance of eating healthy. In my past I did not eat healthy and work under hazardous environments which affected my health deeply. Since then I changed my whole life style of eating and way of thinking, since then, my health has not gone worst. Western medecine did not help, but through the use of pills, treatments etc...only aggravated the symptoms and other body organs were getting affected.<br>
<br>
I really had to make a fast and correct desicion to change my life style and it work . I done heavy research in animal cruelty in farms and it is something iincomprehensible how and what these animals must deal with, to the point that not human being can handle.<br>
<br>
Before we use to eat only organic or some food with some pesticide. It was not enough and by having making the new GM food the price of the food that we use to eat so cheap before, has gone very high, making the lower income class end up having to eat mostly GM food. What's it is also happening now is that mostl herbal products having the capacity too cure diseases are been ban from entering the U.S.A. In the near future their thinking about banning totally from consumer all herbal or natural products. The only way for anyone to get it will be through the prescription option of a doctor which also knows very little of natural herbs or processes and will definetly will not choose a natural herbal remedy.<br>
<br>
This is another technique coming from the rich industries for total control, so they can continue sale in higher forms their products. I do not have nothing against western medecine, pharmaceuticals or whom involves, but I do not appreciate the imposition been put on against the rights of people to choose a healthier total environment or a more natural healthier way of living, etc... Imagine a world consuming only GM food, pharmaceuticals quimicals, environmental quimicals and all that it is demoralizing humanity. What it is left now and what will be left for our grand children? I really don' understand how can some humans do cooperate with their own future destruction?<br>
<br>
Before was Divide and we conquer and now is demoralized and we conquer.<br>
<br>
Well I think I have write enough and my english writing skills are not that great but what it counts it is really what we all have in our hearts and minds.<br>
<br>

<div class="content">The issue of cloning and genetically modified food/crops is a very serious subject for discussion and I would also like to know what companies with or without government backing are doing to my food.<br>
<br>
Being/becoming a vegetarian won't be the solution either as many foodstuffs eaten by vegetarians ie soya, various beans and pulses are now genetically modifed though often without our knowing. I wish I could remember where I found the statistics showing something like 80% of soya grown is GM (in the 'undeveloped' world) and so is a high percentage of coffe, tea and cotton.<br>
<br>
Now while it is important for us to be aware of our diet, I think it is also important to stress that modern capitalist society has made food production not for our needs, but for maximising profit. Also our fast lifestyle and consumerist mentality has led to huge increases of obesity in the"Western" world, particularly amongst women and children. Also statistics show that social class is a factor in diet. Put simply, the higher the social class the better quality of food and less health problems as a result of this, obviously due to having greater access to fresher food and of better quality.<br>
So the problem of food production IMO is linked to the the capitalist <br>
'philosophy' of profit before people. <br>
We need to turn the slogan the other way around.<br>

The problems of poverty and social inequity exist, not only in capitalist societies, but in socialism, communism, and every other form of government there is in this world."Profit before people" is not linked to any one philosophy but, rather, to a declining sense of decency and morality that, in our time, knows no geo-political or philosophical boundaries. IMHO, of course.</div>

This one is never mention on the media. I think is extremely sad and I think these veterans deserve to be talk about or we suppose to not know and forget about them, <br>
