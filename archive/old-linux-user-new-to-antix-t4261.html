<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I discovered Linux somewhere in 1992, I think my first kernel was a 0.97 <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
Since then I was using it most of the time and meanwhile I'm using Windows only on the job <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
I was looking for the slimmest, least memory-hogging - yet usable for all-day purposes - Linux I could find and so I came to antiX (found it via Distrowatch). After playing with the life CD for a short time, I installed it last Wednesday. There were a few hiccups (some caused by myself and not everything is back in perfect order yet) but altogether it is one of the best, if not THE best, I have encountered since the last few years. Slim, fast, uses not much memory for itself, including X and the window manager, still it has a good selections of tools out of the box and it's easy to add others(*). <br>
<br>
I was an OpenSuse user for many years, until my system got totally broken by an official security update... Since then I have seriously used Vector Linux 6 and 7 and tried a few others. VL-7 is still my main system until I have antiX in proper shape.<br>
<br>
My goal is to make this system as slim as possible in terms of memory usage, so the biggest amount of RAM is available for the applications. I already decreased the memory usage of my antiX system (right after booting, only root logged in into a text console, X started) to about 96MB <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> And I'm sure that's not the end <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
That should be enough for a first post.<br>
<br>
Best regards from Germany!<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">(*): Meanwhile, after having used Synaptic several time, I see that it does it's job well, but... in comparison to Suse's Yast/Zypper it feels clumsy. Don't ask me why or by god, I'll explain!</span></div>
