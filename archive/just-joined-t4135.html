<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I'm new to antiX and the forum.<br>
<br>
I have been messing about with Linux systems now for a year or two but have only just started using Linux"seriously" i.e. every day as main computer instead of the old (2002) Windows XP PC. This still has a job to do though, as I have a Canon printer which is not well supported by Linux, so the old W-XP system has become a sort of glorified print server and I'm hoping to really connect to it via the network one day, rather than doing print jobs directly on the it, as I do now.<br>
<br>
The Linux PC (main, everyday computer now) is almost as old and I run Xubuntu on it for various reasons which I won't go into now.<br>
<br>
So where does antiX come in? Well, I also have a laptop which is even older than the machines already mentioned. It used to belong to my daughter who once dropped it with the result that the battery would no longer charge and the sound has gone (at least via the speakers - I haven't tried 'phones yet). It had been lying around workless for years and I have been trying various light distros on it. Up to now Puppy and PCLinuxOS were the only ones that worked well, others such as Absolute, Unity, #!, Arch and friends, Manjaro and Bridge had problems, usually with graphics, I think because of the old"Savage" graphics card in this machine (I'm using it now <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span>). I'm not sure how systems that *do* work solve this problem but under Arch, for instance, where you install the driver yourself, I could only get a scrambled screen after X was loaded - same with Manjaro and Bridge.<br>
<br>
So much for all that. Up to now antiX works very nicely on this machine - The absence of a DE suits me fine - I look forward to tinkering with the system and I'm very happy that I can use this old laptop.<br>
<br>
Many thanks to all concerned with antiX for making it possible! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span>.</div>

<div class="content">Hello boss!<br>
Nice to here from you <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
You had me really worried with that question...<br>
I was looking at /proc/meminfo, /proc/cpuinfo, lspci...<br>
It was only when I came to answer, that I saw the bit about inxi -F<br>
which I had missed first time round...<br>
Here it is. It took me some time to figure out how to get it into this message because<br>
inxi -F &gt; inxi.txt results in a fairly illegible file, but inxi must be a very useful utility. Thanks for the tip!<br>

I see the machine is not quite so old as I thought - but old enough... Also I'm not short on memory as I put some extra in a year or so ago.<br>
p.s. I did inxi -Fz to hide certain non-public stuff.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your welcome rokytnji.<br>
So obviously not all Linux Texans are on PCLinuxOS!<br>
I have to say I have a soft spot for it though as it was the first Linux I found that seems to run on any box, however old and cranky.<br>
But who knows maybe I'll get a soft spot for antiX for similar reasons... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
