<div class="content">Hello, Any...<br>
<br>
[Know that I wanted to subject-title this thread:- <em>"charting bootup; bootup2 charting; chart boot2 booting; booty chart; 2boot..."</em> but desire for"understanding" and"stability" got the better of me. (However I will mention that a few cuss words did pass my lips.)]<br>
<br>
I have started this thread because I am having trouble coming to grips with (ie troubleshooting) installing packages which also includes the"installed-but-did-not-show-up-in-the-menu" thing. <br>
<br>
.<br>
<strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br>
<br>
Here's a couple of examples (only)...<br>
<br>
(A.)<br>
Recently I mentioned the"menu trouble" in this thread...<br>
<br>
. grub-2-to-grub-0-97-pkg-in-synaptics-for-that-t6359.html<br>
<br>
(B.)<br>
This effect (ie an installation not showing up in menus after install) is not an"uncommon" occurrence in Linux (ie across distros that I've used). Within the following thread I mentioned another one trying to install Antix-CC...<br>
<br>
. browser-nominated-as-preferred-application-is-snubbed-t6365.html<br>
<br>
.<br>
<strong>THE ISSUE...</strong><br>
<br>
So, such failures have happened before. Now I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. Here's the most-recent install-issue that I want to stick with. <br>
<br>
Using Synaptic I tried to install a package - <em>pybootchartgui</em> - but it did NOT show up in the menus.<br>
<br>
I selected that package - <em>pybootchartgui</em> - in isolation because I figured that it might be a front-end to collecting/re-arranging details into a presentable package of information. The (install) package details seemed to indicate that.<br>
<br>
After installing the above package I could not find reference to it in the menus. I used MenuLibre, and found it, and tried to change a few parameters (ie <em>"visibility","run in terminal","use startup notify",</em>, etc.) but it failed to start. I tried setting it up to run as root. Nup.<br>
<br>
I revisited Synaptic, and searched for other packages called"bootchart". There were several. So I tried to install"bootchart2" (since that is referred to in the screed about"pybootchartgui") but it failed. There's another package with"...antix" in it, which appears to be installed already. I cannot find any reference to it in the menus.<br>
<br>
There is also some reference to a file folder with"dpkg" which makes me wonder if something is removed at install time too - which might present a problem. (I think that's what dpkg is involved with.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, to cut this story short - with the brief on-system search-&amp;-read I've done - it appears (to me) that there may be a"dependency" issue, possibly tied to"naming". However I may not have proper understanding and ability to diagnose that. <br>
<br>
.<br>
<strong>Q's...</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>1.</strong><br>
So, if there is anyone who knows about...<br>
<br>
. bootchart<br>
. bootchart2<br>
. bootchart-antix<br>
. pybootchartgui<br>
. (and/or including any other related pkg)<br>
<br>
...and how they work together (or not) - and the FIX - please advise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>2.</strong><br>
What is the best way to have carried out this procedure - that is, from the actual moment of"thinking" satisfying thoughts like: <em>"OK; that's a GUI to chart boot-up info. (That'll be excellent!) Click on select - yep. Click install - yep. Great! Too easy!"</em> ? <br>
<br>
Please include ALL options (available to a LinUser) right up to the moment of: <em>"Damn; after all that - still nothing! Now what can I do? Suppose I'll have to start a thread and hope for the best again"</em>.<br>
<br>
[P.S. I'd rather have a solution without M-Libre if I can because it appears to do"funny" things. For instance, in trying to work with the above problem I now have 2"GParted" entries in the System menu. (Can't explain that. This occasion and this distro are not alone on that point.)]<br>
