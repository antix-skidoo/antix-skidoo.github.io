<div class="content">Greetings<br>
<br>
I've never really done an introductory post before. I usually just jump in. This time I feel my background has some relevance because of why I've signed up here.<br>
<br>
Brief: Used AntiX round about 2012-2014 for Luna when I was looking for a lightweight OS. Tiny Core was great at coldboots of under ten seconds, but it just lacked a lot of hardware support and became a nuisance to maintain. Was seeking to learn more about the whole GNU/Linux ecosystem and had play with many Linux-based operating systems from Ubtuntu to Puppy to Slitaz. Finally settled on AntiX-base at the time (I think it was 12 or 13). AntiX then was geeky enough to learn on (lots of console tools) and friendly enough to not let me mess anything up too seriously.<br>
Anyway, I eventually became a Debianite and then finally, nearly eight months back, quit Windows completely (I still remember the day I got my “6 Months Clean” chip at my Windows-Anon group, man I was so proud). Anyway, although I've moved on to Debian, I still play with AntiX and track its progress – and I must say it has come a long way!<br>
It's also the perfect distribution for respins in my opinion. It manages to be lightweight but still ships with major hardware support and a more recent kernel than my main machine. The actually remastering tools were buggy the last I played with them (2013/2014ish).<br>
Anyway, my interest in AntiX is back, as is my need to spin it. This spin s not going to be its own distro, just a for-purpose flavour of AntiX so I'll be asking a lot of questions in posts to come because I'm trying to prototype it first (work back from full until satisfied), then produce a clean product (build up from core).<br>

I rewrote my intro post around four times, each iteration becoming more verbose instead of less. I had no idea my life was this packed with information because I'm a very uninteresting person. So I've concluded that supplying the most abbreviated information is the best course of action and letting anybody just ask me stuff. I'll talk about anything you like, even stuff like how my country turned racist overnight, or how I'm an OCD hikikomori. The only thing I will get very militant is about media. If I think a book, game, band, anime, manga, comic, song, movie, or anything else sucks, I am right, you are wrong.</div>

<br>
@skidoo:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2 burning questions:</div></blockquote>
This is all I could come up with on such short notice...<br>
1) How do I make my own matches from home?<br>
2) What happens if I sleep naked during the day in the middle of the Sahara?<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Are you taller than Snoopy's nose?</div></blockquote>
Depends how big Snoopy is. I'm about six foot, although I'm not sure what that means since feet vary in size. I must be around 180cm because I sleep curled up in a ball. Like a cat. Or perhaps a dragon. Or maybe a a dragon-cat, cat-dragon, cragon.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Are you older than a breadbox?</div></blockquote>
which breadbox?<br>
/bin/breadbox<br>
(In older dialect we called it a"bread bin", I'm sure you know of /bin/busybox.... Okay, that one was weak)<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Are bananas really grown in Republic of South Africa, or are they imported?</div></blockquote>
We have just about every climate here, from Mediterranean to semi-desert to tropical (most people think it's like a veld from end to end), so yes, we do grow bananas but we import too, a lot from Namibia. I say Banana Republic as a joke, but inside it hurts. It's a long story and a bottle of Jack is needed. I may post in the politics thread.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What is the intended target audience for the"a for-purpose flavour of AntiX"?</div></blockquote>
At the moment, just myself and maybe some friends who are in a similar situation to me. I cannot work a regular job because I have mental and physical disabilities; OCD and epilepsy (the reason why I'm late to reply is I had seizure and became a bloody mess the night before last and spent yesterday in a daze, but it's all good because after nearly two-hundred shoulder dislocations, you get used to physical pain – by the way, I'll openly talk about my epilepsy, too). Anyway, my spin is basically gonna be pre-configured with all my work stuff, like office software, keyboard shortcuts and some other things. If something else grows, I'll of course make it public so it's useful to others. Maybe I'll end up making my own full AntiX deriv after all, like the MX people, and it'll give me something of meaning under my name.<br>
<br>

Those are the best kinds of people. I'll also try to help where I can since I'll be asking lots of questions.<br>

<div class="content">Hi nonzyro! We have a tremendous amount of diversity in the community here, and one very nice thing about the vast majority of us that we don't mind the diversity. In the overwhelming majority of cases, I'd say we embrace differences because we're all different in some ways, yet common in others.<br>

I do not think that very many of us think too highly of ourselves either. I'm a reasonably intelligent individual, but no more so than most of us in this forum, so that's a"pretty ordinary thing" here.<br>
<br>
Anticapitalista, as I recall, is really more of an educator by profession than a computer professional, yet he's done some good things here - very good, in fact. A number of people have contributed here. A few have been around a long time, many have come and gone, but all have left some mark here, and many of those"marks" now appear either in code, documentation, or were adopted either as suggestions or code improvements, based on feedback. So there are many ways to contribute in a useful manner, and you've already done so, and it is the contributions from you and others, large or small, that make this endeavor really wonderful.<br>
<br>
We certainly do owe great thanks to anticapitalista; his contributions over the past decade probably number into the tens or hundreds of thousands of hours by this time, and others have poured thousands of hours of help into this stuff too.<br>
<br>
Stick around for the next decade; perhaps your contributions will also add up. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
