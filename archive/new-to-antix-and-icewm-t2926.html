<div class="content">Hi to all,<br>
<br>
I'm new to antiX and am learning to use the icewm desktop, which I am not familiar with as I mainly use KDE. There are lots of other applications I am not familiar with as well, but will get to know them when I click on them. So far, the experience in installing was great as the instruction sidebar was very helpful, which I installed on a 25 G hardrive that also contains W XP. I've installed antiX v 8.5 on my husband's older P2BD asus board which has two Pentium III processors and 1 G of ram. I was impressed with the helpful documentation readily available without having to have an internet connection, especially since we use dial up (partly due to unemployment and partly due to the only access available here in the countryside of the mid-West). <br>
<br>
The only problem I am having is that after setting up gnome-ppp, it fails to connect due to permission problems, an age old problem that is annoying as it has never been fixed upstream. I have to do a"su" to switch to root, enter root password and can use wvdial in command line, but not as user. I thought I'd try ppp (pon poff) and ran pppconfig as root, but when I give command"pon [my provider name]" I get an error that I am not a member of dip group. Strange, since when I do"id [my user name] it shows that I am a member of groups dialout and dip (gid30). I see"sudo" is installed but cannot do a sudo wvdial, only su and then enter root password. I don't like running apps as root.<br>
<br>
I'm not familiar with command line groups, and did not find control center , system , manage users to be very informative as to what group my user belongs to, only in how to repair or add or delete a user. <br>
<br>
I guess I shouldn't post my problem here, but did want to say that I am pleased with this small imprint operating system that works well on this computer. Thanks for the hard work that went into it!<br>
