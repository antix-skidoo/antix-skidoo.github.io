<div class="content">I'm trying to resurrect an old PC for a family with even less money than me.<br>
<br>
I did have an old version of Kubuntu (2006, I think) running on this box. IIRC, everything just worked. But I can't recall if I needed external speakers or not.<br>
<br>
I'd rather not have to tell these folks they have to go out and buy speakers, especially if it's not necessary.<br>
<br>
The sound test tells me it was successful, alsamixer lets me play with all the controls (to no avail), I do hear beeps when appropriate.<br>
<br>
I have done much googling, but most of the solutions refer to alsa-base.conf, which doesn't seem to exist on this antiX15 install. Nor do I have a /var/lib/alsa/asound.state. Or an .asoundrc. I'm new to antiX, so I don't know what's normal.

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>MommaBear wrote:</cite>
I'm new to antiX...</div></blockquote>We all were at one time and had to start learning somewhere. Because of this the following is a little more detailed than usual to help get you started.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>MommaBear wrote:</cite>
Sound from external speakers, but not internal (topic title)<br>
[...]<br>
The sound test tells me it was successful...</div></blockquote>Based on those abstracts and the inxi report, the following assumes that you have all the correct drivers and such installed. If this assumption is incorrect none of the following will apply.<br>
<br>
The sound system in antiX is named ALSA. It's configuration is based on cards and devices. To see their currect state do the following steps in a terminal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Show the audio cards and devices known to the system</strong><br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>aplay -l | grep card</code></pre></div>Note that is lowercase letter L. The output should look something like this<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>card 0: SI7018 [SiS SI7018], device 0: trident_dx_nx [Trident 4DWave]
card 0: SI7018 [SiS SI7018], device 1: trident_dx_nx IEC958 [Trident 4DWave IEC958]
card 1: Modem [SiS SI7013 Modem], device 0: Intel ICH - Modem [SiS SI7013 Modem - Modem]</code></pre></div>In almost every case card 0 is the correct card and device 0 is its correct device. Subsequent steps are based on that idea. If your system uses a different card (perhaps for hdmi output) it might use a different card and/or device number.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Show the state of each audio control</strong><br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>amixer --card 0</code></pre></div>The output should look something like this truncated report<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Simple mixer control 'Master',0
  Capabilities: pvolume pswitch pswitch-joined
  Playback channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Playback 0 - 31
  Mono:
  Front Left: Playback 21 [68%] [-15.00dB] [on]
  Front Right: Playback 21 [68%] [-15.00dB] [on]
Simple mixer control 'Master Mono',0
  Capabilities: pvolume pvolume-joined pswitch pswitch-joined
  Playback channels: Mono
  Limits: Playback 0 - 31
  Mono: Playback 0 [0%] [-46.50dB] [off]
Simple mixer control 'Headphone',0
  Capabilities: pvolume pswitch pswitch-joined
  Playback channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Playback 0 - 31
  Mono:
  Front Left: Playback 22 [71%] [-13.50dB] [on]
  Front Right: Playback 22 [71%] [-13.50dB] [on]
[...]</code></pre></div>The key parts to note are the name in each section header (shown immediately following <em>Simple mixer control</em>, together with its state [on] or [off]. The state [off] indicates the control is muted.<br>
<br>
It is possible that a needed control is set to [off] and simply needs to be toggled to [on] in order to output sound.<br>
<br>
At this point alsamixer could be opened (Control Center--&gt;Hardware--&gt;Adjust Mixer). <br>
<br>
The mixer interface will display the name of the selected card. The F6 key enables the card to be changed (if needed). <br>
<br>
Each of the controls in the previous report corresponds to a control shown in the mixer display. It is possible to use the list to toggle an [off] state in order to activate the control. In the mixer display, toggling is done by using the arrow keys to select a control, then pressing the <em>M</em> key. At the foot of each slider control <em>MM</em> indicates the control is muted [off]. When toggled to unmute it, <em>OO</em> is displayed on a green background.<br>
<br>
Note: some controls might not be able to be toggled.<br>
<br>
<br>
The report used in this step contains both muted and unmuted controls. This can make the list very long and cumbersome to work with. If preferred a report can be produced that lists only controls that are muted [off].<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Show the state of each muted audio control</strong><br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>amixer contents | grep --before-context=3 'values=off' | grep --after-context=3 'numid='</code></pre></div>The output should look something like this truncated report<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>numid=5,iface=MIXER,name='Master Mono Playback Switch'
  ; type=BOOLEAN,access=rw------,values=1
  : values=off
--
--
numid=28,iface=MIXER,name='3D Control - Switch'
  ; type=BOOLEAN,access=rw------,values=1
  : values=off
--
--
numid=14,iface=MIXER,name='Line Playback Switch'
  ; type=BOOLEAN,access=rw------,values=1
  : values=off
--
--</code></pre></div>The key parts to note are the name in each section header, together with values=off. This indicates the control is muted.<br>
<br>
Again, open the mixer and toggle the outputs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course non of the steps using the terminal are essential. All the work could be done directly in the alsamixer interface. Hopefully, the terminal work will give you a peek at ways of finding additional information and help with your exploration of antiX.</div>

<div class="content">Hi SamK:<br>
<br>
Sorry for the delay in replying. I had another issue that took much longer to fix than I anticipated, but I think I've got it now.<br>
<br>
I'm not on the antiX box right now, but I did all the stuff you suggested. The only things that were turned off were the capture settings. I'm assuming capture is for the mike, video, etc, as these are all muted in alsamixer. <br>
<br>
When I ran aplay -l | grep card it listed 2 identical cards (V8233A) both card 0 but one is device 0 and one is device 1.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Of course non of the steps using the terminal are essential. All the work could be done directly in the alsamixer interface. </div></blockquote>
Yes, that's what I tried initially. This is a newer version of alsamixer than I have on my Mint 17 box. It has some controls I'm not familiar with, but considering the age of the antiX box (ca. 1995), I doubt they'd be relevant.</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>MommaBear wrote:</cite>The only things that were turned off were the capture settings. I'm assuming capture is for the mike, video, etc, as these are all muted in alsamixer.</div></blockquote>Yes, capture refers to controls related to recording sound.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The state reported of working with external speakers but not with internal speakers is an uncommon condition. <br>
<br>
From your opening post
<blockquote><div><cite>MommaBear wrote:</cite>I'm trying to resurrect an old PC...<br>
...I do hear beeps when appropriate.</div></blockquote>
Question<br>
Is the machine a laptop or desktop/tower system?<br>
<br>
Laptops (even very old ones) were produced with internal speakers for audio replay. Desktops/towers were often manufactured with a miniscule onboard sounder device to output system beeps. In such a case audio replay was intended to be via external speakers.</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>SamK wrote:</cite>The state reported of working with external speakers but not with internal speakers is an uncommon condition. </div></blockquote>
I found quite a few posts on the web about it. As usual, they were mostly Ubuntu issues but I'm familiar enough with Debian-based distros to translate the answers. Trouble is, I've never used Gnome (KDE's my preferred desktop) and many of the answers refer to Gnome tools.
<blockquote><div><cite>SamK wrote:</cite>Question<br>

A very old Proteva desktop/minitower, for which I found many complaints, but this machine has always worked reliably (touch wood).</div>

Are you certain this desktop/tower unit contains stereo loudspeakers rather than only a simple mono beep sounder? A peek inside the case will confirm this and also give you an opportunity to check the loudspeaker cables to ensure they have not become disconnected. If they have detached it might account for the symptoms you reported.<br>

The machine is a hand-me-down, no manuals. IIRC, it was built from parts at Staples.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>SamK wrote:</cite>Are you certain this desktop/tower unit contains stereo loudspeakers rather than only a simple mono beep sounder?</div></blockquote>
See my original post. I was hoping something in the programs that give system info would tell me this. I did google <em>how do I know if I have internal speakers</em> but didn't find anything.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>SamK wrote:</cite>A peek inside the case will confirm this and also give you an opportunity to check the loudspeaker cables to ensure they have not become disconnected. If they have detached it might account for the symptoms you reported.</div></blockquote>

Again, see my original post. I can't find alsa-base.conf or /var/lib/alsa/asound.state or .asoundrc on this antiX15 install. But altering these files were suggested fixes.</div>

Thanks for the info. I had no idea about either one.</div>

<div class="content">It will be unwise to continue without the previously requested information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Visual inspection with the case removed</strong> will remove all doubt about whether a pair of stereo loudspeakers are present (rather than a single mono sounder) and if they are present their cables have not become disconnected.<br>
<br>
This is an essential step as it will potentially remove the need for further investigation. <em>If it reveals internal stereo loudspeakers are not present, external loudspeakers will be required.</em><br>
<br>
It will also give an opportunity to verify (and confirm in the forum) the motherboard details correspond to the information you posted. It is common practice for the manufacturer to stencil the make and model details onto the motherboard. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>A system configuration report</strong> will provide a basic description of your system components together with their set up. It gives context to your reported issue.<br>

<div class="content">Sorry again for the delay replying. I've never opened a computer case, didn't even have the right screwdriver. Then I realized I had no idea what internal speakers would look like, went googling.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>SamK wrote:</cite><strong>Visual inspection with the case removed</strong> will remove all doubt about whether a pair of stereo loudspeakers are present (rather than a single mono sounder) and if they are present their cables have not become disconnected.</div></blockquote>
So it seems there aren't any speakers in here. I realize now I asked the wrong question. The question should have been, <em>Can I tell with software if I have internal speakers?</em> The answer appears to be no.<br>
<br>
I hope I haven't wasted too much of your time. At least I'll know where to start if I run into the problem again.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.</div>

trying to get internal sound to work<br>
<br>
HI,<br>
<br>
I had been using an old Labtech pulse 485 speaker system with my desktop machine, a System 76 Ratel running Ubuntu 14.04. The system 76 forum seems to have gone comatose, so I am trying here.<br>
<br>
The external speakers are broken, and I don't want to try to repair them. I would rather use internal system sound, but I can't seem to get it to work. I tried both analog and digital using System -&gt; Sound, rebooted, and checked for volume control and muting, but nothing worked. I assume there must be some sort of internal sound system there, how do I get it working?<br>
<br>
Thanks.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>OK, after taking a look inside, although there is an internal sound connection, there is no internal speaker. No wonder it didn't work.<br>

Sorry to waste people's time. </div></blockquote></div>
