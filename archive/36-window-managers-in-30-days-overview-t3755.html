<div class="content">Hey, that's a really nice collection of window managers to review. Of course, like everything else, people have opinions about their favorites, but at least the choices are there, so I commend the author for his work, and secipolla, I thank you for pointing this one out to us.<br>
<br>
For me, when it comes to window managers, IceWM is my favorite. I find it faster and easier to modify than just about anything else, though Fluxbox is really easy to configure too. For those who mess around with Openbox, I don't know what their infatuation with XML-like syntax is all about. To me, that just makes larger configuration files (or more of them), though I suppose an argument can be made that Openbox and some of the newer window managers do have features built-in, whereas they appear to be a bit more"tacked on" with older window managers like fvwm, twm, and IceWM.<br>
<br>
When it comes to desktop environments, people will probably make similar arguments: a desktop like Xfce is just too old, limiting, etc. For me, I find it easier to configure. But at the end of the day, it's not an argument with me at all, as long as my personal choices are preserved. I'm just grateful that each of us can choose what we prefer to use, and that's what is so nice about this article; it's an excellent survey of what is available, whether we personally agree with the preferences and opinions stated or not.<br>
<br>
Good find, thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi secipolla - good to see you here!<br>
<br>
I followed that thread 'live' so to speak. Some of those wms I had never even heard of and some I had tried. Since I'm pretty lazy, I avoided the ones that need knowledge of haskell or whatever and tried out some of the others such as sctrotwm/spectrwm, i3, evilwm.<br>
<br>
Since following that thread I have in fact switched my daily wm from fluxbox to ....... wmii!<br>

<div class="content">Just tried this one:<br>
clfswm - A(nother) Common Lisp FullScreen Window Manager<br>
and failed miserably (couldn't do no single thing <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> ). It looks funny, but most of the geek ones do. <br>
<br>
As of now i have used (in chronological order)<br>
kde 3 on kubuntu (for ca 1 year)<br>
gnome2 on debian (for ca 2 months)<br>
fluxbox on debian (no idea, say 2 or 3 months)<br>
e17 (ca 1 year)<br>
xfce for ca 1 year now<br>
Every other day i ran into icewm, either when MeanDean fiddled with it in refracta or with antiX.</div>

<div class="content">Hi guys.<br>
nadir's 'experience' is common to many and here's where that post (a 'window manager 101') comes handy.<br>
It has some obvious statements that we sometimes need to hear from someone else, like 'as other tiling window managers, it's recommended to read and even print the manual before starting using it.'</div>

I do that a little bit, but not as much as I used to, and I haven't worked with those three that you mentioned, but I have messed around with the one that you're liking now, wmii. I have not built up a strong attraction to it, but it has some merits.<br>
<br>
I put Xfce on antiX base and I'm lovin' it. It was actually ErieFisher that first intrigued me with the idea years ago, since I had been a fan of Xfce using other distros. I tuned up SimplyMEPIS with Xfce and I generally put Xfce on just about everything I use. At my current hardware's age, Xfce still works well.  In two or three years, if I still have this hardware, I may have to use IceWM and Fluxbox more often. When my Dell Dimension 4100 really got old, I went to IceWM with it a lot.<br>
<br>
Speaking of that, I have a 2004 vintage Dell Dimension 3000 that I got at the end of May from my oldest sister. I put it upstairs in the den, installed antiX-base M12.0 Pre Final on it, set it up to autologin and automatically select JWM, put a nice theme on it, big Web browser icon, and my Mom uses it to read Email. It's not fast, but it works really cleanly and puts some life into an otherwise really aging machine, but one that's rock solid, and actually works quite well.<br>
<br>
So these different window managers, different strokes for different folks, really get the job done well. IceWM and JWM are the two I probably use most as WM, but Xfce is overwhelmingly the most frequent desktop environment that I use, and it works great with antiX.</div>

<div class="content">I guess I am one of the few to be running LXDE in one of my AntiX core Installs.<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://forum.lxde.org/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=31202"<br>linktext was:"http://forum.lxde.org/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=31202"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
It was done as a way for me to learn LXDE from the ground up since lots of Linux spinoff distros seem to be going with LXDE for a Lightweight window manager. I am not totally enamored with LXDE and it's quirks. But. Since I did all the hard work dialing mine in. I figured I'd keep it going. Hence the AntiX 12 install on another Hardrive on that Laptop.<br>
<br>
For E17. I stick with MacPup since I have a good relationship with the MacPup developer, runtt21. It is also a learning experience for me dialing it in also. Running Conky on it can be a challenge at best.<br>

<div class="content">My first instance of antiX core was a two desktop system, containing LXDE and Xfce, so I use it and have used it. For me, I find Xfce just a bit more to my liking, but LXDE is nice and fast, Roky; glad you like it!</div>
