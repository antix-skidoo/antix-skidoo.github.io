Trust me i did already and I am not looking forward to that, I spent about 12 hours trying to fix this grub today, and it seems to me I can wipe the drive and reinstall antix, and do all the tweaks again and probably spend at most two hours getting back the way it was.... <br>
Also for anybody out there who gets a problem machine to work on like I had the other week with the IBM T22 and its 900mhz p3 processor which hated the new flash and also its S3 video card which hated almost every linux I tried on it.... I found this out after downloading and burning about 40 different distros for it.... There are two distros that worked on it.... one was antix 13.2 full...<br>
the other was PCLinuxOS lxde edition... I found it to be quite stable on that problem machine even though it installed the latest flash which don't work, I was able to go into synaptic and uninstall the new flash which left me with the older 11.1 flash at which point i locked that flash in so it could not be updated for now until they fix the 11.2 properly to work on the older processors....<br>
so if you are looking for a decent distro give it a shot after you try antix first of course since antix uses a lot less ram....<br>
antix loaded about 43 megs ram and PCLinuxOS uses about 95 megs....</div>

<div class="content">I know this idea is way out in left field but what if I boot my usb stick with antix 13.2 full, then open gparted and shrink my main drive down about 6 gigs and install 13.2 on the new 6 gig drive space, would it not at the end when installing grub find the previous installed version and add it to the grub menu??? I know I would have two antix drives if this works, but then again I could always whack the new one with gparted and enlarge the drive again, then just ignore the second antix in grub....</div>

<div class="content">You could do that but 3 Gig is pretty small for an install. Why not just do a full re-install? It will take the same amount of time (or a little less), it will be a little easier, and it will have a much higher chance of working.<br>

As I said before, the grub error 17 indicates there is something wrong with the partition table which keeps grub from working. The simplest and easiest way to fix it is to repartition the drive. Reinstalling grub won't repartition the drive.</div>

<div class="content">Like Bitjam said. Just install grub to mbr on reinstall procedure. Then if grub errors out. Boot live and post contents of /boot/grub/menu.lst and a a terminal readout (root terminal) of fdisk -l and blkid.<br>
<br>
I kinda ran into your your problems on this box I am posting from with vista on a 160 gig drive. I put AntiX on a partition on a seperate partition on a seperate 2 Terra Byte drive .<br>
<br>
It would not boot because gparted saw /dev/sdx differently than grub mapping. The 2 teraa byte drive was listed as /dev/sda and grub mapped it as (hd1,0). But I found that out. The original grub enry had it as (hd0,0)<br>
<br>
I got a feeling between using a usb stick and a pulled hard drive install. The usb is seen as /dev/sda and drive install is going to /dev/sdb and grub is mapping everything wrong like with me. I've seen this happen on usb installs on my eeepcs. <blockquote class="uncited"><div>I power up again after removing USB Drive. I make sure I hit escape to bring up my boot menu again in bios. I select my 8 gig flash drive as first boot. Every time I wish to boot up AntiX as a dual boot with Xandros, I will have to use escape button to select external 8 gig flash drive in the boot order to boot up AntiX. If I don't, it will just default to booting up Xandros. I am Welcomed with the AntiX Grub Screen. It is quite attractive. I select the top Menu item. AntiX boots. I get a grub error 15. I think in my unprofessional opinion that with 2 internal drives,and one 2 gig external USB,and 1 external 8 gig SDHC Flash card. That grub menu.lst got confused as to which drive was the boot drive for Antix. I have heard from a friend this happens with a Fedora 11 install to a external flash drive also.<br>
<br>
I press any key to continue. Next I press the"e" key to get me to edit the grub entry for booting root. I press e again on the next page. I change the root entry (hd2,0) to (hd0,0), I press enter. Then I press the letter"b" so I can boot. Antix 8.2 Final is now booting up. I press the space bar again to continue with the booting process.
</div></blockquote>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://yatsite.blogspot.co.at/2009/07/install-antix-82-final-on-asus-eee-900.html"<br>linktext was:"http://yatsite.blogspot.co.at/2009/07/i ... e-900.html"<br>====================================<br>
 That was written by me back in the day.<br>
<br>
I did not post about it because I try really hard on my own to figure out problems as they come up. This install was one of the tuffest I had yet between grub (vista still won't chainload), sgfxi (nividia conflicts with noveau in grub line), kernel (using a Debian 3.12 and Anti's 3.13), The only thing left to fix is Vista boot. The wife needs that hard drive on this Desktop which is her Desktop anyways.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is. When I change the bios to boot the 160gig drive. Vista boots fine. I don't want to derail this thread. Just letting you know and hope that anything can be fixed if one is stubborn and as dogged as me.</div>

well I don't understand how there can be an error 17 when there is only one partition on the drive and a swap file... i got two dev/sda1/ antix partition, and dev/sda2 Linux Swap File.... so how hard can it be for grub to get em straight and not mix em up... <br>
I seen partition tables online where people have 10 plus partitions going and are getting grub errors, now that I understand, but 2 partitions is funny that it can't keep em straight.... LOL <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Ok here is where I am at this afternoon... this morning I wiped the new drive and reinstalled the image of the old drive without maxing it out in size so I had a 20 gig drive with a 5 gig sda1 with my antix on it.... In the unallocated space I made another 5 gig drive sda2 which i re installed antix on to sda2... when it was all over grub was working and booting both my old antix and the new antix.... then I did a dumb thing i guess i booted again from antix on usb stick ran gparted and whacked sda2 and then I enlarged sda1 to almost the full size of the hard drive leaving a 1 gig unallocated area, in the 1 gig section i created a new partition which was numbered sda2 and made it linux swap file.... all looked good till I rebooted and I am back to error 17 again....

Is sounds like you need to add an entry for the swap partition in the / etc/fstab file of the original system. You can use the entry from / etc/fstab on the new system as a template. You can test to see if it works with the comands:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>free -m
sudo swapon
free -m</code></pre></div>
If the new system uses a swap <em>file</em> then you probably can't use it on the original system unless you first mount the partition on which it resides.</div>

I know the uuid is different cause the old antix had 2 partitions sda1 and sda2 was swap now sda2 is the new antix and sda3 is swap...<br>
I tried a code i had to fix this problem on ubuntu distros but it didn't work... <br>
but I see antix has a way to change that info it just requires me editing the fstab file which should not be too hard and changing the uuid to sda3 id.... <br>
Thanks Bitjam...<br>
<br>
<strong>Edit: changed the swap file UUID to match the other antix in fstab and now swap file works again...<br>
Thanks again Bitjam... <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

Yeah, a new thread titled <br>

"How to upgrade Netsurf 2.9 to 3.0 in AntiX 13"<br>
<br>
That way new users can find it when searching google.<br>
<br>

But it looks to me that even Sid is stuck at 2.9-2 presently. I don't know what experimental Debian is doing with it.</div>

any suggestions???</div></blockquote>
Yeah, a new thread titled <br>
<br>
"How to upgrade Netsurf 2.9 to 3.0 in AntiX 13"<br>
<br>
That way new users can find it when searching google.<br>
<br>
<span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
But it looks to me that even Sid is stuck at 2.9-2 presently. I don't know what experimental Debian is doing with it.</div></blockquote>
I do all my searches in google, only because the search on all the forums is lame, all words must be 5 letters long and if the term is too common it don't search... LOL so 9 out of 10 i go to google cause when i try antix search i get blown off by the searcher saying my words ain't long enough...</div>

You can get Google to give you results from a specific site using site: as a search parameter. Example:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>site:antix.freeforums.org netsurf</code></pre></div></div>
