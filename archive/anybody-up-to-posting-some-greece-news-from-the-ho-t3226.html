<div class="content">cowonjolt, I've been busy so I haven't had time to reply.<br>

Basically, the Greek economy is f*&amp;^%d (as are many economies), not due to Greeks living a life beyond their means (whatever that means), but because the politicians, bankers and capitalists (local and foreign) have bled the country dry in scandals, sell-offs, tax-evasion, bail-outs. Ordinary Greeks (actually to be precise, ordinary people - Greek and foreign) are now asked to foot the bill.<br>
<br>
The IMF/ECB/EU loans are not the 'save' Greece, but conditions to sell off Greek state owned assets to private companies. Greece is for sale. The vast majority of people here oppose the memorandum of cuts (between 70-80% according to opinion polls) as they quite rightly point out that we have to pay for a crisis that they (bankers, politicians, capitalists) created. Hence the massive demonstrations and the resulting police brutality against the demonstrators 2 weeks ago.<br>
<br>
The government is detested as is the main right-wing opposition party. The struggle against the implementation of the austerity measures continues. It will be a long battle.<br>
<br>
BTW - If anyone wants to visit Greece, it is perfectly safe. Greeks are angry, but they don't blame visitors, just the bankers, IMF, politicians and big business. You'll have a great time here.</div>

<div class="content">Been busy here also Anti,<br>
I browse a lot of news mainstream and not mainstream and that is the overall summary as well. The scene in the US is eerily similar with a large part of the indebtedness created from the illegal bailouts of major US Corporations against the will of the people. The US is a Republic but the US government is acting as if it is a Democracy and that is the problem here in a nutshell. The only real obstacle stopping a world Corporate takeover by the UN/EU/US is the Constitution of The United States Republic and the bankers and politicians are hellbent to undermine it through unlawful treaties with the UN. The very sovereignty of humankind is at stake and I hope and pray the world awakens to who the real enemies are who threaten humankindâ€™s survival. It is not capitalism, or socialism, or marxism, communism or any other; it is the corporation and the laws that govern it's existence that threatens our existence. May human sovereignty triumph in Greece, the US, and the world. <br>
