<div class="content">Brooko, Warren and Paul,<br>
Oh, my goodness, it just works ! I am so excited at the success I had<br>
to tell you all immediately.<br>
This is absolutely brilliant. You have no idea how many distros I have<br>
tried without finding one that could do it all, some would find the wireless card<br>
but not the sound card, over the years one or two have had the tablet-drivers <br>
enabled but did not recognise the native screen resolution and so on and so forth.<br>
I am writing this on the tablet, using Mepis/Antix 8.5 and almost without need to <br>
do any configuration, only the wi-fi setup which took seconds with the excellent network utility. (I went first to the"wireless" icon but this did not seem to recognise<br>
the wireless-card (an intel).)<br>
I am still running in live mode but performance seem quite respectable, and time to have it up+running was very good compared to most live distros.<br>
Anyhow, that is the main news. I would like to try it operating in RAM since, having played with Puppy in this mode it is fabulous. Another useful thing might be to ditch <br>
the slow 1.8"HD and run from a CF card.<br>
I find it funny that tablets have suddenly come back into the news<br>
again after several years and I suppose we have to thank SJ for that<br>
even though he does like to produce pretty but seriously crippled<br>
devices. However, just imagine how many millions of the old generation<br>
of tablets there are out there, mostly gathering dust I suspect because people abandoned them for being slow and perhaps lacking in capabilities. My little NEC is only 1cm thick so is beautifully portable and has all the facilities denied to owners of the new and flashy (oops, it doesn't do flash) tablet.<br>
<br>
Thanks gentlemen for a wonderful job, you clearly have a true winner here !<br>
<br>
Mike.</div>
