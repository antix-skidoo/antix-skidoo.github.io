<div class="content">I join you, like Roky, in welcoming you to the wonderful world of freely available software.<br>
<br>
It was Richard Stallman's intense frustration with computer hardware and software at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology back in 1984 that caused Richard to write the"GNU Manifesto", the document that lead to the creation of GNU - a recursive word that means"GNU's Not UNIX"! (but rather an attempt to completely re-write a functionally equivalent, even superior, system).<br>
<br>
Stallman later formed the Free Software Foundation (FSF) along with GNU, and tries to get people that use any piece of GNU in their system (in his mind, just the GNU utilities or the Linux kernel would require the use of the name GNU, as in GNU/Linux; most people drop the GNU, but Richard really HAS contributed A LOT!<br>
<br>
By replacing and rewriting whatever is not optimal for you, it's possible to come up with an nimble system, and that's what antiX can be!<br>

I don't have any really low spec stuff any more, but as recently as 2008 and early 2009 I was still regularly using a Dell Dimension 4100 desktop with 128 MB RAM (not 1 GB), though I did have two Western Digital HDD, one of which I added to the system to make extra room for 5-10 GB disk partitions, each containing their own unique distribution.<br>
<br>
These days, about the SMALLEST disk PARTITION SIZE is around 10 MB. AntiX can run 100% in memory if you run a modest version or use BASE, That's with a fairly stock setup, not attempting to run too many apps at once to conserve both memory and swap space. Small distros like the various spins of Puppy can do that too.</div>

I am Linux user since Sep 2004 when I bought HP COMPAQ Presario 2500 series Laptop which arrived with Mandrake Linux 9.1 CDs. The CDs had HP Logo and were tailor made for the Laptop, The distributor had clearly told that I can install it but should not expect any support from HP. I could install without any difficulty and started using it and everything worked out of the box.<br>
<br>
I changed to Ubuntu since 5.04 and depended on shipit for CDs of new versions.<br>
<br>
The Broadband became cheaper in my city in Aug 2008 and I started downloading various distributions since the mainstream distributions (with KDE or Gnome) were heavy for my machine which originally had only 128 MB and I could add another 256 MB to run Ubuntu 6.06.<br>
<br>
I never had patience to configure IceWM or Fluxbox, therefore, I was happy when LXDE arrived.<br>
<br>
I discovered antiX on Distrowatch and wanted to see this distribution giving IceWM by default.<br>
<br>
Well, I am very happy and impressed with built-in IceWM configurations, antiX ControlCenter and installer.<br>
<br>
I had installed Debian Lenny Beta 2 on one partition in Oct 08 which was not updated. Instead of applying the tons of updates I have replaced it with antiX-MB Intifada installation.<br>
<br>
I thank the developers for such a nice distribution suitable for old (also new) hardware.<br>

I am back here after four and half years. I have been mainly using Ubuntu LTS releases. Yesterday I made a USB stick using dowloaded iso of antiX-13.2-full and Unetbootin on Ubuntu. After first boot, I added Root persistent using the Control Centre. I am using Tata Photon Plus USB Dongle on wvdial to access internet and it is working fine.<br>
<br>
I like the polished look of antiX and the speed on this old desktop having 512 MB RAM.<br>

<div class="content">Back in the 1960's I heard about this computation thing that could compile data faster than the human mind could. I was intriqued at how something like that could do these tasks. Researching how these things worked led me into the world of electronics, where you built what you needed. I learned Assembly language, then Pascal, Fortran, and C++ while learning how the parts"talked" to each other. Learned Multics to get it all together.<br>
<br>
In college, much of the teaching was to clarify how these electronic pieces were substituting vacuum tubes. The PC was just coming onto the public market, but I was more interested in what chips did what, and how they all got along. I build simple systems using the Intel 4004 and 8008, the Z80, and the Motorola 6800 (not the 68000). Working with the 6809 and the 8080, I learned BASIC and compiling. Near the end of my college, I turned down a job with Texas Instruments since computers were a hobby, and I didn't want to get bored working on the.<br>
<br>
Over the years as a teacher, I spent my spare time learning to develope operating systems and keeping updated on the newer ones coming out. I would tear apart a program to correct errors incoding to make it better, and SIMPLER. Worked as a Beta-tester for Apple and Microsoft for a while, which mostly involved finding bugs and killing them. A lot of times your suggestions and codings are ignored, or kept in that hidden vault to be used later by the big guys. You know that code on a webpage that lets you click on a link and go to another webpage?<br>
<br>
Over the years, I spent spare time teaching other how to use a computer to WORK for them rather than they having to work to use the computer. Worked as a truck driver which gave me time to think and develope a variety of programs to make life easier"on the road". Computers are used to collect data on the engines, the speed, and the location of the truck. The routing of the trucks must be economical and safe. You can't drive a rig that is 13 Ft 6 inches tall under a 12 ft railroad tressel (although you still read about somebody trying to do it).<br>
<br>
Back in 2009, I injured my neck and head at work. I have forgotten more than most people learn in a lifetime, and now have had to relearn almost everything. Sometimes forty years of learning flash by like a movie at high speed, and you try to remember what it was since it was on the tip of your tomgue a minute ago. Learning linux (or rather RELEARNING LINUX) has helped in my rehabilitaion. I have taken old junk computers people no longer want and given them new life. IT'S ALIVE! Puppy Linux as too childish. DSL was okay, but extremely limited. Red Hat and Ubundu acted fat and sassy. Crashbang #! kind of forces you to learn to do almost anything, but was a little to bloated for some of the older systems. A lot of the smaller distros acted like they were hardware dependant. <br>
<br>
AntiX seemed perfect. Just enough learning to make you want to learn more, light enough for an Intel 80286, and enough gui to keep kids interested. Sure, its been a learning process, But if you don't learn, you don't grow.</div>

I aint in some things as smart as I used to be. But like my Dad said when I realized I was bigger and stronger<br>

<div class="content">Hello! This name I chose, kankaren gama-gari, is Hausa for"concrete universal." I don't know any Hausa, I just like how it sounds, and I wanted to use a phrase from Hegel. <br>
<br>
I got to AntiX from Debian, a few years ago.<br>
<br>
In 2003, I used to boot Linux occasionally, to compile Rockbox, an mp3-firmware project to which I was a contributor, writing a text viewer. I did not know how to download Linux then; I bought SUSE in a computer store. <br>
<br>
Soon, though, I tried Knoppix and other live cds. Around 2006, I ditched Windows, because XP would lock you out if you changed the hardware too much. Then I used Kubuntu or Xubuntu for a few years.<br>
<br>
Around 2010, upgrades caused sound to stop working on my old Toshiba laptop (Satellite M115-S1061, from 2006). I think the trouble was mainly changes to the kernel; they removed support for quirks of the particular sound card. I found that with pure Debian the sound still worked. It worked for around a year, until newer kernels caught up with me there too.<br>
<br>
My best solution for the sound problem turned out to involve an AntiX core install. I installed Antix core, then used smxi to install an earlier kernel, 2.6.34, which got the sound working. (Then I installed my favorite desktop, XFCE.)<br>
<br>
I'm still doing it that way on the laptop, and similarly for my two desktop systems, which also have older hardware, and work better with AntiX.</div>
