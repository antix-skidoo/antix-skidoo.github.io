<div class="content">I wrote my story quite a while back. Today, I am experimenting with different combinations that I have added to the default installation. I used smxi to add a bunch of additional window manager and desktop environments. Right now I am using KDE SC, just updated to KDE SC 4.4.4. I added Mozilla Prism as a Web application program, and I've added this forum as a"Web application". Lots of cool things that you can easily do with antiX.<br>
<br>
I love experimenting with the appearance in the two default window managers. Our artists and configuration experts have done a superb job with this system. With the solid Debian underpinnings, the great integration and configuration work done by Warren Woodford, and the excellent flexibility that anti and his helpers have added to create this distribution, along with extra tools, such as smxi from h2, the extra ideas and contributions incorporated from other nimble distributions, add it all up and we have one awesome distribution!</div>

<div class="content">I came to antiX after using, at various times (and not necessarily in chronological order): Ubuntu, openSUSE, Fedora, Mandriva, Linux Mint, and Debian Squeeze. The *buntus, especially 10.04, ran way too hot on my laptop, and while I was pretty happy with Squeeze, I wanted something that I could easily customize from the ground up (especially after finding the Liquorix kernels, which made a vanilla Squeeze install work faster and fixed suspend issues I'd been having with it.)<br>
<br>
Started with antiX base, put Liquorix kernel in it, slapped gnome-core onto it, edited /etc/uswsusp.conf to get hibernate working correctly (it was set to /dev/sdb2 as the resume partition for some reason, probably because I installed off of a USB/unetbootin install?), and wow. This thing FLIES. Fastest hibernation/resume I've seen on any Linux distro I've ever run.<br>
<br>
Also using it on my desktop at work.</div>

<div class="content">as for me, i heard about linux almost two years ago and thought it would be cool to use something else and maybe have a good alternative to windows (i always hated it).<br>
my first distro was ubuntu and i don't know why but i didn't really liked it so i moved on.<br>
my next distro was opensuse, i completely fell in love with it. it worked so good and it was such an awesome distro. opensuse made me delete windows and use linux since it was just so much better than windows.<br>
then i felt the urge to experiment with linux and test other distro's since opensuse (as good as it was) still wasn't perfect. it was great but it missed something, so i went distrohopping.<br>
every now and then i found i distro i liked but beside that i found small and fast distro's capable of working on old pc's. i began thinking about reviving some old pc's and began searching for a good lightweight distro. after some searching i found antix. it looked promising so i tried it.<br>
WOW! <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
it was awesome! it was perfect! this distro had what i was missing: lots and lots of flexibility. it gives you a super base to begin with and then gives you what you need to shape it into your own completely personalised distro. it was so great i installed it on all my pc's and is now my main os.<br>
and that's in short <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> how i got into linux and eventually antix.</div>

<div class="content">Neato thread, I've never seen this before. Then again, I never really looked. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
My first Linux install was with Debian 3, I believe it was probably Sarge because it was sometime in 2006 when pidgin was called gaim. I didn't actually install it myself, but expressed an interest to one of my friend's who used linux and he installed it for me and made sure everything worked properly, like wireless and printer and other crap. He taught me the basic commands and using the terminal to do stuff and compile and build deb packages, and not that checkinstall silliness. He also thought it was really important to learn how to compile my own kernel, so he taught me that and wrote the directions down so I wouldn't forget what to do. I rarely do it anymore because I'm way too lazy and just use the liquorix kernels. Last time I did it was for one of the updates to 2.6.32.xx. I used KDE throughout this time.<br>
<br>
Around 2008, I guess, I tried ubuntu gutsy or maybe hardy and I thought it was neat that I didn't have to setup my own wireless. I guess, you could say it was kubuntu because I installed KDE right away. I stayed with ubuntu, even though I thought it was very buggy, but I'm lazy. It wasn't any worse than windows.<br>
<br>
Then when kde 4 came out, I found Mepis 7 or 8, I guess, was the only one or few using KDE 3.5, so I switched that. I then distro hopped over to sidux for a short period of time. I forget why. I didn't stay with sidux too long when I found out using smxi in sidux was a big no no and got turned off by how rude they were on their forums. I read about the feud on tech patterns and found antix through that website and read it was a slimmed down, no useless bells and whistles and I stayed around 2009. I then found out that there was a forum specifically for this distro last year. I'm slow. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
I have briefly used fedora and opensuse, but their forums seem like dick central and that turns me off. This forum and mepis forum are the politest linux type forums I've been on.</div>

 <div class="content">It all started with a great idea to upgrade from Debian 5 to 6. Mind you I had made a previous attempt and I knew the potential consequences... so here I am a broken system and recovering my files. <br>
I started with Redhat to Debian to unsure but AntiX is slowly convincing me. <br>
It's sleek and fast and it's brilliant a offering indeed.<br>
I hope you guys can cut a niche for yourselves much like backtrack or Ubuntu has done. <br>
There is an idea, porting backtrack tools into your os or even hacking and programing utilities. The whole idea you guys have to find a specialty....niche</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>buttcoffee wrote:</cite>This forum and mepis forum are the politest linux type forums I've been on.</div></blockquote>
I agree with several of your points, especially this one. The MEPIS site and the antiX site are two of the most hospitable distro-based forums in existence. Particularly interesting is the fact that though anticapitalista has some political convictions, he has never once rammed them down the throats of others. They are lightly mentioned on occasion, and that's about it. Same with distribution setup, configuration, and other matters. The antiX distro is all about choice, not trying to restrain or restrict anyone for any reason, nor jam any one viewpoint at anyone.<br>
<br>
I have a great deal of regard for every single person here, whether we share the same views or not, and it is this openness and willingness to accept more than one point of view, plus a genuine interest in helping others that are some of the hallmarks of this distribution. Yes, it also happens to be one of the best distributions in various ways, but it stands out even more because of these excellent forums.<br>
<br>
I thank everyone here for being a part of that distinctive characteristic of antiX!</div>

<div class="content">Hello everybody, <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
I'm a french teacher and antiX interests me because it's stable, light, powerful, and beautiful. All my congratulations! I made a remaster (with your very usefull tool"remaster") in french if you are interested in: I have changed icewm menu appearance (live and installed), installed samba server, removed some command line tools and translated some of your scripts to make the distrib useful for french users. My project is to use this distribution at school with old computers and educative softs.<br>
You can PM me if you want to try the french version or use the translations in antiX.<br>
May the force be with you!</div>

Welcome to antiX Steph.<br>

Good project you have going there. I'd like to have a try of the French version and certainly the translations will be useful for antiX.<br>

<div class="content">Greetings. I arrived recently from Ubuntu. My Dell Dimension 2400 PC, bought new in 2004, ran Windows XP for years until, after I retired, I decided to try linux. I'd picked up some Unix commands during my working years, which was a help, but choosing a distro was a problem. First choice was Mandriva, but I found it hard to get used to and when it stuck in mid-upgrade I switched to Ubuntu on the advice of an expert (he has a black belt in sudo). <br>
<br>
I found this more user-friendly, but after a while X would freeze, maybe once or twice a week, calling for a restart using Alt.SysReq+B each time. This, it turns out, was a problem suffered by many users whose machines used the Intel i8xx chipsets and I must have tried every workaround to no avail. I hung on, always expecting that the next kernel, or the next system upgrade, would fix it - and some users found that 10.10 did the trick. In my case it didn't, the problem got worse so, being lazy, I went for the hardware solution and bought a secondhand Fujitsu Siemens PC of similar vintage, and it runs Ubuntu perfectly. This, though, left me with an unusable Dell tower PC which was taking up space. I tried Ubuntu 11.04 on it but couldn't get more than half an hour's use before it froze, so something had to be done. Xubuntu was no better. Did some Googling, and the word on the web was that antiX might be what I was looking for. By this time I'd tried Puppy, which would run OK but I didn't fancy being 'root' all the time, so I gave antiX a try. It loaded as a live CD and it stayed up, so I've installed it and am very pleased. Any new system involves a learning curve, but I'm finding my way around and have installed nearly all the applications I need.<br>
<br>
After many years involved with IT systems, I appreciate the need for resilience, and now I have some. I've no doubt there will be some things I don't understand, so I may well have some questions for the forum before long. Meanwhile, I'm delighted with antiX.</div>
