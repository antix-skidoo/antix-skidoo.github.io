<div class="content">This is just a story I wanted to share about why upgrading to sidux is dangerous. I decided to install the new previous of AntiX (7.02) on a machine and then dist-upgrade to sid. I followed the instructions in another thread (enabling all non-sid repositories, dist-upgrade, reboot, enable sid repositories, reboot).<br>
<br>
Upon the first reboot, with the new sid system, my system refused to boot: It gave me an error that it could not mount the VFS system. I figured this might be due to a libc6/kernel mismatch or a problem with the default kernel install of MEPIS, which does not use an initrd. Thus, I booted up the livecd, chrooted in, and installed the latest sidux kernel.<br>
<br>
New error: the root device /dev/sda1 cannot be found. I'm dropped into a busybox shell from the initrd, so I switch to UUID tags. No go. Finally, I switch to /dev/hda1 (which is deprecated) and it finally works. However, fstab still uses the old naming, so fsck chokes on booting. I finally boot into single-user and fix the problems.<br>
<br>
I hope this is helpful to anyone who has trouble booting the old or new kernels after upgrading to sid.</div>

Just asking for a bit of clarification. <br>
<br>
Do you mean sidux upgrade or sid upgrade?<br>
<br>
The sidux repo shouldn't have been left in preview1 and it certainly won't be in the final. The sid repos will be there, but commented out.</div>

As you're using sid/sidux interchangeably I doubt you really know the difference. For reference:<br>

the former's a debian release (I'm gathering that's the guide you're referring to) , the latter's a debian-based distribution.</div>

anti, the sidux repos were in preview1, although they were commented out, because i enable them by mistake, and then disabled them again after you informed me that it could cause probems. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

Hmm, I am going to have to take a look at that! I LOVE sidux. I find it does a great job protecting me from the perils of Debian Sid, providing me with a cutting edge distro that actually works.<br>
<br>
Anticapitalista has mentioned, over at the USALUG, that he has been experimenting with sidux in some of his stuff. I believe I have a copy of preview 1.</div>

I'd be interested to know what you think &amp; how you find it if you get the time. I enabled them by mistake when i installed preview 1, and then when anti mentioned that they may be problematic, i disable them again. LOL! I don't mind taking risks, but i'm not that good yet, and if it breaks i probably can't fix it. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
But i am running 3 antiX systems here (on 3 different machines) two using Deb testing &amp; one running sid, and all are running fine. <br>
<br>
You mentioned the"Perils of sid"? What do you mean by that? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I thought (Probably mistakenly) that sid &amp; Sidux used the same (or similar) repos/releases etc? <br>
<br>
If they're just as safe/fragile/unstable as sid, then i may as well use Sidux &amp; see what happens. Hmmm, maybe ANOTHER antiX install is calling!? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
