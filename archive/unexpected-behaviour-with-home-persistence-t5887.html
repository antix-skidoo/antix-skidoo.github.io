<div class="content">I used Antix15 to make myself a custom live USB. Works great. In that custom system there's a single user with elaborate changes in the home folder (e.g., there is a q4wine installation with C:-drive in the home folder) and desktop (new launchers mainly). I also wanted to use persistence, both home and root.<br>
<br>
When I choose to boot with home persistence enabled, I expected to find back all my customisations, with the ability to add even more, which would then be saved in the persistence filesystem. What I saw was very different: my single user gets a new home folder, and a new desktop, which is essentially in the same state as the demo-user in freshly downloaded Antix-CD.<br>
<br>
I could copy over (by hand) my custom user settings to the persistence filesystem, and from then on everything worked fine. But I had expected a somewhat smoother experience. Maybe all this is by design, but I wanted to report on my experience never the less.<br>
<br>
Oh, and one more question. When setting up persistence in the Antix2usb script, one only has to decide on the size of the home- and root-persistence files. I divided all free space on the USB between the two. But when setting it up in the Antic-CC there is talk about a bunch of other persistence files (backups or so, I guess). Do I have to provide room for these extra files too?</div>

<div class="content">You found a BUG !

<br>
I'm posting to confirm. With"home only" persistence, I get the same buggy result dirkd described.<br>
It's seems like $home is being populated from <em>/</em>etc/skel. <br>
<br>
tested by booting a fresh antix15 full 64bit pendrive and, during live-session:<br>
-- changed wallpaper and theme for"demo"<br>
-- created another user account"jojo"<br>
-- performed isosnapshot using default settings<br>
<br>
booted the pendrive created from snapshot iso and noted (perhaps indicating additional bug)<br>
-- during init, a line stating"Error: Unknown distro name: Linux" is displayed (and logged to live-init.log)<br>
-- boot menu F5 did not present a"root only" option <span style="color: silver"><br>
If run from an installed system, iso-snapshot would have retrieved the newest live-init.<br>
If I had performed dist-upgrade prior to snapshot, the"root only" option would have been available in my snapshot result?<br>
</span><br>
Using the default boot entry (no persistence), both"demo" and"jojo" are able to login.<br>
<br>
With home persistence enabled, the content of /home/demo"seems same as <em>/</em>etc/skel"<br>
With home persistence enabled,"jojo" login via slim fails.<br>
<br>
With home+root persistence enabled, the content of /home/demo"seems same as <em>/</em>etc/skel"<br>
With home+root persistence enabled,"jojo" login via slim fails.<br>
^---- here,"jojo" __is__ able to successfully login via Ctrl+Alt+F2 console (probably same in"home only" scenario. I neglected to test that)<br>
<br>
With root persistence enabled, both users are able to login. Everything is as-expected.<br>
(note:"jojo" account had never actually logged in prior to snapshot, so having /home/jojo built during first login is expected.)<br>
<br>
<span style="color: green">the problem seems to be within live-init but nothing remarkable shows in the logs</span></div>
