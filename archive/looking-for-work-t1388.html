<div class="content">The last day on my contract at Fidelity Investments is today. I have worked for them since September 2005, and I also worked for them before during Year 2000 testing during 1998. I have a good rapport there, and I hope to have at least one, possibly several, recommendations coming from associates and managers there.<br>
<br>
I am looking for project management or QA work - both skills are current, as I've done a smattering of both over the past four years, and even a bit of"glue" type scripting in Bash, Perl, and Python, though I'd only consider myself competent in Bash.<br>
<br>
I am quite the jack of all trades though, a quick study, effective learner, always willing to teach others what I've learned. I enjoy testing, as many of you here know.<br>
<br>
On the project end of things, I have become adept at smelling out bad and failing projects and helping to effectively terminate the bad ones, saving the company time and money.<br>
<br>
If you know of leads or contacts in the industry, do let me know. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">I don't have any leads, but I wish you well in these difficult times.<br>
<br>
2009 is going to be a tough year in the present economic climate and I fear things will get much worse for workers, unless they fight back and win a la France.<br>

I am sorry for your job loss; I don't know of any leads either. My husband's company just announced a mandatory pay cut for everyone; at least they still have jobs. I'll pray for you and your family and a job soon.</div>

<div class="content">Brian,<br>
<br>
I sincerely sympathize with you.<br>
I lost my employment fifteen years ago, during the last IT"crisis" in France.<br>
It took long months to find a new job. <br>
Luckily in France we have a social welfare that works, that we want to be maintained.<br>
<br>
The 'social movement' we had in France last Thursday does not pretend to have the economic crisis solved by magic.<br>
We want to have the education system preserved, we are opposed to social welfare fund cuttings when the government refunds the banks... <br>
<br>
I work in a IT service company.<br>
The strike thursday was not only followed by public companies employees or union members.<br>
There are in France layoffs announced in Hewlett Packard, Motorola... Guys who thought they have a steady job in a famous company.<br>
Some of us were in the streets of Toulouse on thursday afternnon. A nice sunny afternoon. Among more than 50.000 people.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>un sticker a obtenu un franc succès au coeur du cortège parisien avec pour slogan « Rêve général »
</div></blockquote>
« Rêve général »= General dream instead of: « Grève générale »= General strike<br>
<br>
Brian, I wish you the best in your job hunting.<br>
Don't give up<br>
<br>

<div class="content">Sorry to hear this Brian. I hope your not out too long. Maybe think of it as a short rest and enjoy some of it.<br>

You could always come to my place and shovel a couple of feet of snow but I wouldn't recommend it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all of you. I have not landed any opportunity yet. I am just trying to make my network - of friends, forum partners, and so forth, as robust as possible. You never know when that may lead either to an idea or directly to a specific opportunity. I still dream of the day when I can take my combined interests of research and testing Linux distributions and apply it to some real life situations. During my time at Fidelity, I actually DID get to leverage my UNIX and Linux skills for a while, as the market data applications migrated from Sun Solaris' UNIX implementation to Red Hat's RHEL. I was also able to move into project management and lessen my direct role in QA testing, which had been one of my objectives. With that, I now have two very current skills - in QA and Project Management, both of which I have used actively in the past year.<br>
<br>
I have to keep job hunting and spend most of my time doing that, but as I can spare a moment here and there, I intend to keep using and testing Linux distros, and I will most certainly continue to use and test antiX, SimplyMEPIS, and sidux heavily.<br>
<br>
Thanks again everyone for your kind words. If any of you do come up with either ideas or leads, I am most appreciative of them!</div>
