<div class="content">Hi to everyone from <em>Al Andalus</em>, spain, one of the USA colonies in the very south of EEUUrope, known in the rest of the world for its famous bullfights, the flamenco song&amp;dance (including hitsingles like"Macarena" <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> and many other variants of rumbitas songs) . A beautiful land full of the funniest spaniards of the whole peninsula speaking an alternate castilian spanish with less letters per word than the official one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Im really amazed <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> with the job made by anticapitalista, and the rest of the crew involved, in this lightweight linux distro. I love how it looks since the first time I saw it, and I love its elegant simplicity for newbies in linux (like me <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> ).<br>
<br>
Ive tested some VMware images in 2 of my PCs, a desktop Pentium4HT/2gb RAM/sis655fx chipset; and a portable P dual core t2300E/2gbRAM/intel mobile 945GM chipset. In both PCs my spartacus virtual machines work fine, and now Im thinking about installing, at least one of them, in native mode, but first Im testing the tools and programs included in antiX, because most of them are new for me, and at the same time Im reading about antiX (and mepis) and looking for some info of these lightweight distros, and the compatibility with my hardware.<br>
<br>
Ive got another 2 old PCs at home that my brother gave me a few years ago, both in good conditions, and Im looking as well for any kind of linux distro that I could run comfortably in both of them.<br>
<br>
One of them is an overclocked Pentium 2 mmx (OC just a 12%, everest says) that originally ran at 400MhZ, and now It does at 450Mhzw with just 128mb of sdRAM, and an INTEL 82443bx chipset (original FSB at 100mhz, now 112 mhz). This PC is currently running windows XP (just a bit slower than in other PCs, but it works fine for netsurfing,P2P,mail,etc...the only proble is the ACPI: I always have to turn off the computer pushing the boton in XP) . I think I could try to install here antiX in native mode, but Im still wondering about which version would be the best option <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> and things like that.<br>
<br>
The other PC is an intel 486dx2 (this one has got the mathematic coprocessor) with just 36mb of RAM, no cd rom, no USB, no internet connection ... just a floppy and a hardrive with windows 3.1 (ms dos 6.20) installed working fine. I think that there is no any option of installing antiX here, but Im still looking for any other mepis release (I think Ive readden than the firsts mepis releases run even in some 386 machines, <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I dont know if Im wrong <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> ) or any other linux distro that I could use in this vintage machine. I know this wont be easy, but Im a persistent man. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
anyway...after this boring intro, I would like to thanks again to all the people that works in the antiX project, this community and everybody who has helped in its support. In these last few mouths Ive tested a lot of different linux distros, but I can assure that none of them like this one. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> You have found in me a new believer, a new supporter of this OS. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
Hi to everybody, see you in the forums <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Welcome kifto!<br>
<br>
That PII should run antix with no trouble. I have it running on a celeron 400 and it works great with it. I can't remember if it's version 7 or 7.2, I will have to check.<br>
<br>
For that 486, Spartacus might run on it. The oldest thing I tested was a PI266mmx and Spartacus ran fine, just a little slow but fine.<br>
<br>
Enjoy.</div>

<div class="content">Hi from Thessaloniki, Greece and welcome to antiX, kifto.<br>
<br>
As eriefisher mentions the PII should be ok with antiX-M7.5, though you may want to install the base version and add apps you want, but the other computer may have problems due to lack of RAM. even if you manage to get antiX-Spartacus to boot.<br>
Let us know how you get on.<br>
Probably best bet for the old computer is DSL or DELi linux or an older slackware-based Absolute linux.</div>
