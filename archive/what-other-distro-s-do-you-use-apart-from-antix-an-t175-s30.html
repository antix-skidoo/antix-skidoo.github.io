3. Asus M5N laptop Centrino 1.6GHz 768 MB RAM, 12" screen. It came with XP Pro pre-installed but this one is an extremely Linux compatible machine and now runs Antix on Debian Unstable with a choice of fluxbox or Xfce desktops. Antix is the fastest distro I've used on this machine and works brilliantly. Wireless, suspend, cpu scaling all worked from the install. This is my favourite computer, it's a few years old but I recently bought a 9 cell battery (5 hours life) and I intend keeping this one a long time.</div></blockquote>

<br>
with your antiX being sidified, you should only need to regularly dist-upgrade. I have kept my Mepis 3.4.3 sidified (and siduxed) up to date. I still have it, upgrade it, though I rarely use it now as my antiX-sid does what I want, and fast!</div>

<div class="content">Right now I got Antix M7 RC1 running on both the 1999 travelmate laptop and the"beast" desktop (for my standards anyway - 6750@2.6 D2Core, 2gb ram etc). Will install a more bloated distro soon on the latter (ubuntu hardy heron, current version has problems with the j-micron controllers, won't install properly and I can't really be bothered.) All going well, weather permitting, I should also have an Asus EEE within a few weeks, so add Xandros to the list.</div>

<div class="content">A little update: My Lenovo Core Duo laptop now runs Antix+Xfce on Debian unstable instead of running Xubuntu Feisty. The sound is a small problem, plugging in earphones doesn't disable speakers+subwoofer, have to do that in the mixer and then the sound through the earphones sucks because the bass isn't there....but I can live with it. The sound through the regular speakers is extremely good. This is generally as good as it gets with intel-hda sound controller and the curse of a trick sound system with stupid subwoofer. I've been really keen to get up to date with this laptop and migrate it to a rolling release distro. Tried Arch....hmmm, OK, but used more resources to simply run a plain unconfigured Xfce desktop + no extra services/daemons than Antix uses to boot up with beagle indexing running, wicd daemon, encfs with cryptkeeper applet, conky et al. Yes I am a bad person, I take a superlight distro and run mono apps...shame on me...but it's still very very speedy. Beagle arrived as a dependency of F-Spot and my first thought was to uninstall Beagle &amp; F-Spot and compile F-Spot myself (I know beagle isn't truly a requirement as I've done this before). But I let it run just out of interest and it's impressive, massively improved from when I purged it in disgust from an openSuse desktop about a year ago. So it stays. <em>I think</em> I'm still running Antix but I'm not sure anyone round here would recognise it, and the purists would weep (until they tried it, snappy, light and all mod cons). So now at 2 laptops running Antix sid systems and 1 Xubuntu Gutsy desktop. Btw is it called Gutsy cos it's big and hungry? Anyway I think the desktop is going on a severe diet this week and will emerge from it running Antix (testing not unstable) + Xfce.</div>

I love Xfce...didn't really use it on testing, just dived right into upgrading everything to unstable expecting it to break. I had a clonezilla image of Zenwalk, my previous distro on Asus laptop, and thought I'd be needing it but Antix+Sid+Xfce just keeps on working <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I find that occasionally on upgrading there's a conflict like 2 different packages want to write to the same file but it's usually fixed in a matter of hours, I haven't got as far as feeling the need to post a bug report. I'm also happy keeping the Mepis kernel even with all the cutting edge stuff on top of it, it supports all my hardware just as well as the newer kernels do and I've found the new linux wireless system with built in support for intel 3945 is full of problems. I can live with a unicode blob for the moment if it means the thing actually works. I notice the newer kernels (2.6.24) are more resource intensive too, at least on my hardware (having tried it on Arch, Zenwalk and Xubuntu 8.04 alpha). <br>
<br>
Xfce is pretty amazing, performance fairly close to that of fluxbox and it has some great customisable features like Thunar custom actions and big selection of panel applets. I still like &amp; use fluxbox (cos I forget to hit the F1 key when slim starts....doh) but when I feel really lazy and want convenience and as close as possible to zero brain activity I prefer something else.</div>

yeah thanks, I'd done that already on one laptop...keep hoping to remember to do it on the other. I just spent today installing and setting up Antix on my desktop so now all my computers run Antix+Xfce...and Sid...couldn't help myself. There was stuff I particularly wanted that hasn't made it into testing so I got them from Sid and then went the whole way with an upgrade and dist-upgrade.</div>

<div class="content">I have antix 7.1 on my laptop: It is less than a year old and I consider it my main"box." I have wolvix on my old laptop. (It will be my daughter's when she's old enough. I don't know which distro will be installed on it, but hopefully she'll eventually be able to choose one.) I have antix 7.1 on my old desktop. I am going to reinstall winxp on it and take it to work. (I can't install programs or even use the dvd burner that comes with the classroom box; the district office has pretty much crippled my ability to use it, update it, etc.) So the school admin suggested I bring in my own box so that I can be the admin of that box. I have an old desktop that I built with the help of a friend. Most of the parts are within 5 years old. It is still a powerful machine. I will probably run mandriva, pclinuxos, or mepis on it for a kde environment, wolvix for slackware and the xfce desktop, and maybe a third distro (fedora is looking good lately). I plan on using the old desktop for a few tasks; e.g. it has two dvd burners so copying discs is a breeze. If it has a better sound card than my new laptop, then I'll also use it to record vinyl and some old cassettes I have lying around. So there you have it.<br>

AntiX 7.2 is installed on a Dell Dimension 4100. No other distribution seemed to run well on this hardware. This machine used to be the worst out of all my machines, now it is used a lot! I have been a big fan of Fluxbox ever since I followed a"How to" written by Anticapitalista on the old Mepis forum. <br>

LinuxMint Daryna is on my home built Athlon XP 1800+ machine. LinuxMint got me to like Gnome! This machine is for anyone to use, it is customized with newer versions of the mint tools and is fully optimized. My son and daughter use this machine when they come over to visit, there was no learning curve for them with Daryna.<br>
<br>
My Wife has a one year old Accer laptop with Vista Ultimate installed. My Wife is an avid gamer and this was the best option for her needs. This is the slowest machine we have yet has probably the best hardware. <br>
<br>
I have another home built Athlon XP 2600+ machine that I use for testing LinuxMint releases. When I am not testing for Mint the pc has whatever looks interesting on it.</div>

<div class="content">My kitchen PC is the one that has been running linux the longest.<br>
Started with Mepis 6.5 then switched to Mint 4 and finally running Ubuntu 8.04. I'm waiting for Mint 5 to go final but might not replace Ubuntu since it's all setup and a real joy to use.<br>
<br>
I have an old Compaq with a 900mhz Duron which I have been trying to setup samba server on using AntiX 7.2, TinyMe 2008 and MiniMe 2008.<br>
To much of a noob to get it working ... yet.<br>
<br>
My Asus EeePC is running the default xandros and I installed Mandriva 2008.1 spring on a 16GB sdhc card and it runs great. Mandriva is the only distro that officially supports the Eee PC.<br>
<br>
I have a really old Compaq PII 350 mhz running as a FreeNAS server for over a year. I just love this thing ... whenever the XP boxes stop talking to each other, they can always connect to the FreeNAS server and I transfer thru that.</div>
