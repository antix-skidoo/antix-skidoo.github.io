<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://lamiradadelreplicante.com/2015/07/01/antix-15-excelente-distro-ligera-basada-en-debian/"<br>linktext was:"antiX-15: excelente distro ligera basada en Debian"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Seems like a very postive review. Here is a Google translation:<br>
<br>
<strong>antiX-15: an excellent light distro based on Debian</strong><br>
<br>
<em>It has released a new version of antiX, a distro of those who call light able to run efficiently in all kinds of hardware, from ancient Pentium II and III to modern processors, but without giving up offering a nice appearance and He has caught my attention for its flexibility.<br>
<br>
We are talking about a daughter Debian comes in three different flavors: Full, Base, Core and whose minimum performance requirements are just 64 MB with a pinch of swap in its most Spartan version (Core) to 256 MB that asks us the most complete version (Full) which is what I've been trying for a while.<br>
<br>
The vocation of light distro note without complex desktop environments and instead use window managers.<br>
<br>
Default comes with icewm but we have other window managers to choose as Fluxbox, JWM or Herbstuluftwm served on more than a dozen different combinations with other system elements, such as the case file manager (Space, Rox) . All at your fingertips from the applications menu and in just a few seconds without having to log out.<br>
<br>
It is a very versatile distro, you can run in live mode from CD or USB memory with or without persistence and is very compatible with any branch of Debian, to the point of being be configured to be rolling release and choose from the same installation time to that point Debian repository (sid, testing, stable).<br>
<br>
It also has excellent control center with which we can handle many aspects of the system , and that has nothing to envy the more well-known distros.<br>
<br>
New antiX -15 version represents the transition to Debian Jessie , a new kernel (4.05 ) , update the office suite LibreOffice , the mailer claws- mail 3.11 for the audio have to xmms player while the video gnome is responsible -Player , we also find updated versions also typical elements of Debian to iceweasel 31.7.0esr web browser and even some self - development as streamlight antix to streaming videos with different resolution , which admittedly looks great.</em></div>
