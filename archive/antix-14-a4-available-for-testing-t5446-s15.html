<div class="content">[cross post from MX Forum]<br>
First blush: it looks great! I really like the new theme and icons. I installed it on the test partition of my AAO 722 (specs below), which went very smoothly.<br>
<br>
Couple of quick things I saw (didn't spend much time on any of these):<br>
--Ceni totally unable to work with my Atheros card, though Wicd had no trouble.<br>
--On this netbook, the bottom panel covers up the Antix and world logo. Resolution is correctly set.<br>
--Couldn't get a video to run in SMPlayer--might be b/c of the two sound cards, have not yet put in the .asouncrc file--nope, made no diff<br>
--Suspend didn't work<br>
--I find it annoying to have the docs dialog box come up every time I log in<br>
<br>
Will look more seriously tomorrow. But for now: congratulations on a fine new OS in the offing!<br>

<div class="content">This is from skidoo:<br>
<br>
Why is the kernel not SMP -aware?<br>
An oversight? Because it produces a smaller compile kernel?<br>
<br>
As is, with my same as ever testing hardware... I'm seeing 90% CPU load just from scrolling a browser window.<br>
With several apps running,"tearing" or blocky artifacts occur when a window is dragged.<br>
===========<br>
<br>
boot menu option"boot from first hard drive" fails for me.<br>
It's looking for hd0?<br>
If I specify hd1, correct-looking entries for each of the other installed O/Ses is displayed,<br>
but I get a grubby error (same error)"Error 22: no such partition" when selecting any entry.<br>
(reported as an apparent bug, even though it doesn't impair my immediate use)<br>
===<br>
<br>
boot menu: absence of"custom boot" line<br>
Apparently it has been omitted by design. The result feels like a serious usability regression<br>
I would need to memorize all the"stuffs" and retype them each boot? (remove"quiet", add"splash=v", add"toram", etc)<br>
(ouch)<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
boot menu: F1"using the help system" screen<br>
Does the text REALLY need to 'splain to the user"consists of a sef of linked pages..." ?!?<br>
Howabout, instead, simply"use these keys to navigate the help pages"<br>
and<br>
why DAZZLE the user with either / or choices for each navigation command?<br>
left OR backspace<br>
right OR enter OR space<br>
up OR home<br>
down OR end<br>
Like... is there a chance that a given user's keyboard will NOT have an Enter key, but WILL have a space key?<br>
(yep, reads like petty criticism, but clarity of helptext is a serious issue)<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
boot menu: F1 ---} second"F7" link, labeled"save bootloader settings"<br>
the helptext states<br>
"on liveUSB + frugal, the F6 Save menu should appear, replacing the F6 desktop"<br>
Okay, the link is labeled F7... but the helptext is discussing F6<br>
and<br>
as is, when booting liveUSB,"F6 Desktop" is, in fact displayed (contrary to the helptext)<br>
(reported as an apparent bug, even though it doesn't impair my immediate use)<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
question / observation:<br>
bootmenu F4 does not support multiple selections, right?<br>
As a result, in the absence of a saved, replayable"custom boot" line<br>
user wanting both"toram" and"automount=usb" must hand-edit during each boot, right?<br>
<br>
=========<br>
<br>
uuidd<br>
why? Is this a leftover, got injected by debootstrap during build?<br>
I killed the process and purged uuid-runtime package... and haven't noticed any ill effects due to its absence.<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
wondering:<br>
Should packages"syslinux","extlinux" and"syslinux-common" be apt pinned?<br>
(potential issue is that isolinux, needed for snapshot, is absent from one of those newer packages)<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
etc/aptpapt.conf.d<br>
"never markauto-sections<br>
...multiverse/ddlibs"<br>
???<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
perceived issues with the default theme:<br>
1) grAy beside gRay (cannot easily discern active vs inactive toolbar tabs (seen in geany, spacefm, etc)<br>
2) unchecked checkboxes are essentially"invisible" due to checkbox border matching dialog box color (seen in synaptic etc)<br>
3)"zebra stripe" alternating lines (spacefm, synaptic etc) colors 1&amp;2 are too similar<br>
4) nearly impossible to discern (how GRAY is gray?) which toolbar icons represent currently inactive (greyed-out) commands vs available commands<br>
5) similarly, difficult to discern active/disabled drop-down menu commmands (and toolbar"display text only" command text)<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
cosmetic issue:<br>
@1920x1080, both the bootmenu screen, and the desktop background display stretched, egg-shaped blue earth<br>
<br>
===========<br>
package file-roller 5Mb is installed (plus dep. nautilus-data 13Mb)<br>
but I haven't found anywhere (rox-filer context menu? spacefm context menu?) it's accessible via any desktop app.<br>
? Is it an orphan introduced by debootstrap during build, or is some DE plumbing for it missing?<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
package flashrom<br>
Whoa! Why is this pre-installed? (it's a vector for major, irrecoverable, exploit)<br>
If it just got pulled in by debootstrap, please remove it. If it has been included by choice, I'd like to hear the"damn good reason" why.<br>

Don't know your reasoning for claiming it could cause or be subject to expoloits, but here is its home page.

<div class="content">With the old Dell Inspiron 8100 I booted via plop boot floppy from a USB flashdrive, all defaults, and got this pop up message. <br>
<br>
Also, why ins't there a launcher with maybe a little camera icon or menu option or desktop launcher to do screen shots? I couldn't guess a hotkey for it either, but i see the script is there and it does work if called manually. Anyway, there should be some easy way to get to it, I think...<br>
<br>
Also, can we have scrollbar arrows on scrollable windows, please? its very difficult to scroll a window up and down without them because you never know in linux whether it will scroll a page at a time or all the way at once.<br>
<br>
Also, on defaults, why is it rox, not spacefm? Its not worth fightinng a battle over because its easy to switch, but i think when it boots up on defaults it should look as impressively good as it can get. just sayin...<br>
<br>
PS: you can turn off the screenshot if you like. I tried 4 times to take it off the screen, but can't<br>

cause the boss likes it that way. its pretty light and fast once you get the hang of it. <br>
<br>
seriously though, if you start the liveusb with one of the spacefm desktop options, you'll find the defaults are now all spacefm related. This can be overridden in the desktop-defaults app if wanted. For instance, you could run the rox-pinboard desktop and have spacefm the default file manager, or vice versa.<br>
<br>
fyi, for usability, the script that is set as the default in desktop-defaults really needs to be in the same folder as the file manager apps, or finding that script could prove difficult. perhaps links to rox-filer and spacefm desktop files in the same folder as the script would make more sense.</div>

I was going to test videos on my XP partition on here on /dev/sda1. But ntfs-g in live session<br>
errors out on mounting via rox as demo user. Spacefm does not show /dev/sda1 in the side bar as user<br>
or root. <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Mounting /media/sda1

Other than that. Booted fine. Good screen resolution (better than the IBM T23)<br>
I have a idea for the IBM. I might hook up a external monitor that handles 1600x1200<br>
resolution and try and post from it. Just a idea.<br>

"mount=all" cheat code gave me access to windows xp.<br>
<br>
I was able to play music and video as user during live session.<br>
Only difference was usb drive was /dev/sda1. XP was /dev/sdb1 in /media in rox.<br>
<br>
Everything worked. Sound and Video. Wicd used for connection of wifi,<br>

So. For me. This test covers single core atom N270 netbooks with intel graphics.</div>

actually, the wallpaper app in the control center will set the wallpaper in whatever wm session you are using at the time. <br>
<br>
the screenshot app is in the menus under graphics (used to be in the top level).<br>
<br>
there is one way in which file-manager selection isn't honored 100%...currently spacefm -d is used for mounting devices like removable media. No matter which file-manager is selected as default, removable media will open in spacefm.<br>
<br>
the icon themeing looks very nice in both rox and spacefm. spacefm should probably be configured to show internal devices by default. right now it only shows removable devices in the side panel.</div>

<div class="content">skidoo, sorry, i'm not going to sit here and try to quote/unquote and bold etc. too tired at the moment for that and its not important to me. Please dont take offense.<br>
<br>
popup? The dialog box displaying a pair of buttons labeled something like"read docs" and"close docs"?<br>
For now, as in the earlier alpha, that's a work-in-progress wrinkle (hardcoded to popup at start of each session) <br>
<br>
----no, i posted a print screen showing the error message box, i assumed the open docs one was on purpose.<br>
<br>
Also, can we have scrollbar arrows on scrollable windows, please? its very difficult to scroll a window up and down without them<br>
because you never know in linux whether it will scroll a page at a time or all the way at once.<br>
<br>
Which windows? The controlCentre dialog windows?<br>
<br>
----browser, terminal, synaptic.... the problem is more acute if the window is displaying a long list and doesn't move you a page at a time like synaptic or some of the terminal screens. Its maddening not knowing which windows are sending you many pages away vs when they are only going 1 at a time. Normally I would want to click and hold down an up arrow to scroll up, or down arrow to scroll down. I'm I can click the scroll bar and it moves me one page per click, this is less of a problem, but in synaptic and the terminal it was lunacy.<br>
<br>
Ive run into (but never mentioned) a related usability pain point: some dialogs are opened small and are set <strong>non-resizable</strong><br>
<br>
----Fluxbox wasn't letting me resize lots of things, like terminal windows. I don't know the others have the problem or not. Maybe its by design with fluxbox.<br>
<br>
----The screenshot save dialog is an example of a too small dialog box because its very difficult to get in there and scroll the list and select someplace. I was able to resize that one.<br>
<br>
Also, on defaults, why is it rox, not spacefm? <br>
<br>
----It was just the opinon of a distro hopper (me), and I noticed how space's website mentions antiX prominently as an example of their system in use, and I think their's is a superior system. I am a roxterm fan, but not rox filer fan. As I said, its not worth fighting a battle over. But its kind of sad to see them promoting antiX and then the default in antiX without asking for a preference is Rox. But its not a big deal to me.<br>
<br>
----screenshot question... I was using fluxbox (I think) or maybe jwm at that point, now I forget, and trying to print the screen with the error message and tried a bunch of keys trying to GUESS what key will cause a screen print, and finally I had to go hunt it down on the menus. It could have been on accessories menu or the hot key could have been more obvious, thats all. It shouldn't be difficult to do a print screen, IMO.<br>
<br>
----there is nothing wrong with wallpaper functionality that I know of</div>
