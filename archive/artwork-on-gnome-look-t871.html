I just wanted to thank Sakasa for his efforts.</div></blockquote>Well exploder what can I say, sometimes my words could be taken as nice but my heart is bigger than all the beautiful words I know and in it will remain an infinite keeping of your beautiful words. I'm glad that many of you can share the well intentional images that my mind sees. OU812, I know Impuwat has beautiful artwork in KDElook.org in case you do not know. But it is also a very good idea if he can add his artwork to gnome.org if he is not to beasy. I am sure he will do it without a blink. I wander in gnomelook.org if it is easyer for you guys for us to post the artwork?<br>
<br>
Thanks you all very much for such a humanitarian act.<br>
<br>
Best Wishes to all of you!</div>

<div class="content">I will be the fourth for that motion. Thanks Sakasa. You are a force of nature! There appears to be no end to your creativity. I enjoy logging in and seeing where your muse has taken you.<br>
<br>
Thanks also John &amp; Sakasa for your kind words. I will look at gnome-look and consider the options. antiX related artwork seems a little out of place at kde-look but antiX is in a league of its own.</div>

<div class="content">JawsThemeSwimming428, impuwat, OU812, anticapitalista, exploder all I have found on this forum is great people, greate thinkers, great beings.<br>
<br>
I do not defirenciate people from nature, it only becomes different from nature itself when there is no compassion or unconditional love for others.<br>
<br>
To be natural requires a will Master of changes, through a continual sacrificial understanding of the self, not defirenciating people from nature or people from people. We have water, oxygen, minerals etc...in our body, these are the same elements as from the Mother Earth (No difference).<br>
<br>
When we banish our blood steams into the air and it becomes water in a cloud, the bones become a wooden mineral etc...only this happens when the body is let naturally banish.<br>
<br>
Well I yes want it to let you know that your comments are really a personnal thing to everyone and these are a apart of nature that it is talking, that it is offering an energy of life itself. It is a great gift to be giving life and doing or choosing good from bad then all things becomes and creates life instead of dead environments.<br>
<br>
Thank you all keep on the great work and believe that all of your good actions are the seed of good creation and from it you will find inner peace sooner, this is the only way for all of us to reach to be great, to be not separated and to have a real union with and from our know it all Mother Nature.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all.<br>
<br>
Best Wishes!</div>
