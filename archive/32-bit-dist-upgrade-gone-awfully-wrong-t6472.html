<div class="content">Yesterday I did a full upgrade of my Antix 15 system and I sorely regret it. I had Testing repo's enabled.<br>
<br>
[*] I lost sound in firefox (just saw some possible remedies in another post that I have yet to try).<br>
[*] I use three different keyboard layouts. Those are gone too. I tried to get them back via 'configure system' in the control center, but several 'locale' settings seem to be broken.<br>
[*] Desktop seems to behave differently. Before upgrading, I could change workspaces by mouse-scrolling on the desktop, now<br>
[*] Worst of all, my wifi-settings have become unstable. Half of the time I don't get an IP address from my router. I can't set up a fixed IP anymore, or I don't have a DNS-server configured (when using DHCP). For more than a year I haven't had a single wifi problem: booted the system and in less than a minute I was online. A warm reboot doesn't fix the problem. A cold reboot sometimes does.<br>
[*] Half an hour ago Firefox disappeared without warning (I was connected to facebook). The whole desktop stopped responding. Couldn't even logoff/logon, or restart conky.<br>
<br>
In case someone asks: yes, I suspect systemd crept in, but I don't understand much about that so I'm not even sure.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions about repairing my system?</div>

How I bailed my system upgrade out<br>
<br>
post47421.html#p47421<br>
<br>
But I run Jessie stable and in / etc/apt/preferences.d/00sysystemd I have<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Package: *systemd*
Pin: origin""
Pin-Priority: -1</code></pre></div>
To keep systemd from creeping in on dist upgrade unless I give permission by unpinning it.<br>
<br>
Good Luck with it. I assume a good md5sum was done before a burning media and installing AntiX 15. That is something I religiously do to keep ghosts out of my machines. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">I have the same 00systemd configuration file, so maybe I'm still systemd free.<br>
<br>
In the mean time most problems have been repaired. All of them were caused by configuration files that were overwritten without my realising so.<br>
<br>
The only problems that really bother me still are the unstable wifi configuration and not being able to share a printer with Windows.<br>
<br>
Here's my theory for the wifi. Is it possible that the timeout for the dhcp-client has been reduced? That could explain why dns-servers are often missing. Although my wifi signal has proven to be stable, it's not really strong. In the past I could often see 4,5 or more dhcp-discovery cycles when booting before a dhcp-offer was detected. Now the system boots up so fast that I can't even read the messages flashing by. But alas, often without a working internetconnection.<br>
<br>
If a shorter time-out is indeed the cause, how do I configure a longer one?</div>

You can use the locate command to find the file you think you might need to adjust the time on.<br>
like<br>
<em>/</em>etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf<br>
<br>
maybe? Like I said. I do not really know.</div>
