<div class="content">I have not got full details yet, but I thought I would post just in case it is a known issue.<br>
<br>
I have just loaded Antix on a netbook that has previously run Lubuntu. With Lubuntu it always connected to any WiFi around without a problem.<br>
<br>
With Antix the netbook will only connect to WiFi if it does not have a security key. I have found this using two broadband routers (SFR and Orange) - in each case if the router is set up with a key (WPA2-PSK) the Antix system fails to make a connection when DHCPDISCOVER is launched. If I change the router to"no security" the connection is ok.<br>
<br>
I am still investigating (by searching the internet) - but I wonder if anyone else has seen this problem?</div>

Nope. I have connected to wpa2-psk at home, on the road, etc.....<br>
<br>
But I use Wicd normally instead of Ceni and have not had a problem and I have been running AntiX since version 7.<br>
<br>
Maybe ISP is different in France than in TX?<br>

I have added wicd, though I have not removed ceni (I haven't found where to edit the AntiCC files); now when I boot up to connect to <strong>unsecured</strong> WiFi there is a short delay when the browser cannot find any WiFi and reports web pages unavailable - after maybe 30 nseconds a connection is made and all is well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have not yet tried with a secured WiFi, since I need to change tha router security and this causes havoc with my wife's connection. I will do so when she is not wanting to be on-line (anything to preserve marital harmony!).<br>
<br>
The output from inxi above is from after the connection to WiFi has been made, so presumably does not really help. I will post again when I attempt to connect to secured WiFi.</div>

<div class="content">I have noticed that you have not updated your video drivers yet . So going on that assumption you have not updated the system..<br>
Let's see want happens after an update. We are going to use a script, that I feel is really handy with Antix.<br>
<br>
. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1, you will go out of X, and get an empty terminal screen, fully black with a login prompt.Then log in as"root"<br>
Next type in" smxi" then follow the on screen instructions. After the update select continue when you see the option for your video driver select it. You now need to select the correct driver yours would be labeled" intel" .<br>
<br>
After everything is updated make the selection to exit the script. at the prompt simply type reboot then enter,or just press Ctrl+Alt+Delete<br>
<span style="color: #BF0000">Please make note of any errors. If you have errors post them so we can work though them. <br>

<div class="content">I have a similar problem. 3.7.10 installed &amp; worked fine - wireless just used the settings from 3.5.0. I installed 3.8.0 and ceni reported that there was no network. I installed 3.8.4 (last niight) and wireless wouldn't connect.<br>
<br>
NOW: this is not a new problem. At the end of November 2012 BT started work to install cable broadband into the village and co-incidently router we use here dropped off my Samsung - <strong>but continued to work on the netbook</strong>. At first I thought it was the <strong>Samsung</strong> but found that using <strong>Windows 7</strong> worked fine. Ultimately I installed <strong>antiX 32</strong> on the Samsung and got wireless back.<br>
<br>
OK so the problem seems to be connected to 64bit Linux distro's (I tried a number to see if I could work out what was going on - same result for all), the Samsung &amp; (maybe) changes by BT. The Samsung had run 64bit distro's for a year without problems and my main installation <strong>SuSE.12.2</strong> had run, undisturbed for a year. After November, nothing worked.<br>
<br>
On Friday, I installed <strong>openSuSE 12.3 64bit</strong> on the Samsung and it worked fine (the 1st 64bit piece of kit to have wireless on the <strong>Samsung</strong> for 3 months). Last night I installed the <strong>3.8.4 32bit</strong> kernel on the <strong>netbook</strong> and got the same result I've been getting (pre-<strong>SuSE.12.3</strong>)from 64bit on the <strong>Samsung</strong>. I enclose a couple of screenshots by way of illustration:<br>

This first one shows the result of running <strong>ceni</strong> using 3.7.10. The <strong>Netgear</strong> router (our router) shows plainly while in this 2nd shot - 3.8.4 - it's disappeared:<br>

<div class="content">I find in densely populated areas with a LOT of wifi access points that wifi channel signals are often the culprit of issues, even though circumstantial evidence may suggest other sources or causes of the problem. To determine whether that is actually the case or not, see if you can figure out how to manually select the wifi channel on your router. If so, then use a scanning tool that can identify the other wifi channels in your area with a signal strong enough to interfere with yours, and if possible, choose a different channel. For me, I've rarely found a kernel that doesn't behave properly when:<br>
<br>
1. The correct wireless firmware is installed; on my hardware, the Intel Pro Wireless firmware works really well with some systems (I've had really good success with models that use Intel Pro Wireless 2200 (old) and 3945 (starting to get old too). I've had slightly less initial success with Broadcom; my device firmware uses the Broadcom 4311 wireless firmware; you can generally find it, but some distro developers choose the Broadcom STA wireless firmware; I have inconsistent results with that firmware; if you happen to have Broadcom wireless network hardware, I recommend using either the b43 or the b43-legacy wireless firmware, depending on which card you have; I've discussed this elsewhere, but both the Debian and the Arch Wiki sites have really good documentation about this; refer to one of them if you cannot locate my discourse on the topic in this forum.<br>
<br>
2. I reprogram my wireless router, replacing automatic channel selection with a specific channel that others are not using; until someone comes along and starts using the same channel that I use, this works well for me; where I live now, I have not had problems in over a year.</div>

<div class="content">Hello again<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the ideas - I have been today to our holiday home which has a secure WiFi connection. Until today I could not test with a secure connection.<br>
<br>
The computer did not connect via WiFi, so I used the AntixCC"Network" tab to check Interfaces (Ceni, though I have installed wicd) and set the key for the secure network. Still no joy!<br>
<br>
So I connected using an ethernet cable - the connection came up without a problem. I then disconnected the cable and the connection continued perfectly via WiFi.<br>
<br>
I shut down the computer and rebooted and the WiFi came up without a problem! <br>
<br>
<strong>The problem is that I have no idea whether I dare take the AntiX computer with me on my travels when I need to connect to a WiFi network.</strong><br>
<br>
I realise, of course, that I have not provided enough detail (logs, etc) of the problem; but i was at our holiday home (which we let to holidaymakers) to try to fix a problem with drains and so I was not fully concentrating.<br>
<br>
@Elno - I have another, old laptop running AntiX, and I tried your"smxi" update on this - it failed with error 100 and therefore I have not tried it on the netbook with the WiFi problem.<br>
<br>
@masinick there are not a lot of WiFi access points here - our nearest neighbour is about a kilometre away and has no idea about computers!<br>
<br>
At our holiday home there are perhaps 10 routers within WiFi signal radius.</div>
