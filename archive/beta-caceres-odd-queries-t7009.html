<div class="content">I recently upgraded to 16.1 from 13.2 on an X64 CPU and ext4 partitions, on an old AMD PC. Installed clean runs well - congratulations ! I am using SpaceFM window manager and desktop. I have a few queries that the community may have answers to ? Thanks to all in anticipation.<br>
<br>
1. Iceweasel does not appear, is that browser finished with now or is an upgraded version to be made available ? If not can I remove the desktop icon ? No problem I am using Chromium, Google-Chrome or Firefox. Iceweasel vers.22 was becoming unacceptable to my online bankers security checks.<br>
<br>
2. How can I change the background colour on the toolbar CPU and eth0 monitors from black to white ? I can't see them well enough to be useful.<br>
<br>
3. Can I put a shutdown button plus other option buttons on the toolbar as in 13.2 ? I read the text about it in the config file but didn't understand it well enough to get things changed. <br>
<br>
4. Why is the install button left on the menu when the install is complete ? can it be removed easily ?<br>
<br>
5. Where can I find the dialogue to define preferred applications in a list when a file name is clicked ?<br>
<br>
6. Where are the terminal applications from 13.2 ? I was using the app to write an iso file from a bootable CD. Is there an alternative ?<br>
<br>
Best wishes to all and thanks for a fine product.<br>
<br>
Sincerely<br>
<br>
Roland</div>

<div class="content">firefox replaces iceweasel. You can remove the iceweasel desktop icon.<br>
<br>
Howto change toolbar background color? Depends on which window manager you are using ~~ which is a detail you didn't mention. Are you saying the color does not change when you select various different window manager styles/themes?<br>
<br>
Can I put a shutdown button plus other option buttons on the toolbar as in 13.2 ?<br>
Again,"howto" depends on which window manager you are using ~~ which is a detail you didn't mention.<br>
<br>
Why is the install button left on the menu when the install is complete ?<br>
Idunno. Maybe you performed a snapshot, and the snapshot utility re-created a launcher entry?<br>
This will remove the launcher file:<br>
[color-green]sudo rm /usr/share/applications/antix/minstall.desktop[/color]<br>
You can remove the menu entry by visiting ControlCenter--} Edit JWM Settings<br>
(or fluxbox or icewm) and search for, and delete, the line mentioning the"install" menu entry.<br>
Followup by clicking"update Menus" within the desktop menu.<br>
<br>
Where can I find the dialogue to define preferred applications in a list when a file name is clicked ?<br>
Sadly, there apparently is no"one single place" to do so, because rox-filer file manager and spacefm file manager differ in how they"pick" handlers for various file types. Your starting point would be to use the"Preferred Applications" utility available in antix ControlCenter. Afterward, you will probably ALSO need to tweak the options/preferences settings within the spacefm and/or rox-filer dialogs.<br>
<br>
"I was using the app to write an iso file from a bootable CD. Is there an alternative ?"<br>
within the desktop menu:<br>
Applications --} System Tools --} iso-snapshot<br>
Perhaps this is what you want?</div>

<div class="content">I am using space-iceWM<br>
<br>
I don't recall taking any snapshot - I just did a straight install fron a CD and it ran right through clean. I kept my existing $home.<br>
<br>
As an aside 16.1 recognises a USB pendrive very quickly when inserted compared to 13.2 on this ancient PC which may only have USB 1.0. 16.1 takes about 5 seconds to show it up as a device in SpaceFM, while 13.2 takes up to 5 minutes for the same. Any reason for such a difference ?<br>
<br>
I was using Bleachbit every now and again under 13.2 and sometimes cleared up to 1gb of temp files and junk. Bleachbit I can't find anywhere under 16.1, is it not necessary, was it ever worthwhile, was I wasting my time with it ? If so how do the ext4 indexes get tidied up ? Is this an ongoing process that I can forget all about ? <br>
<br>
At times I can hear the hard disk working away for a short while for no apparent reason when logged into email, various forums or web browsing under Chromium or Firefox. Is this to be expected ? I never noticed it under 13.2 with Iceweasel. Occasionally it slows up somewhat then frees up again.<br>
<br>
All these points are interesting but relatively trivial - 16.1 is very good, you all deserve a mention in dispatches for the hard work you have put in.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your replies, I'll have a go at your hints this week.</div>

<div class="content">Bleachbit was probably omitted in the newer build due to trying to minimize the ISO size.<br>
So just <span style="color: green">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; apt-get install bleachbit</span><br>
<br>
"13.2 takes up to 5 minutes for the same. Any reason for such a difference ?"<br>
If it's working well, instead of guessing"Why?" let's just be thankful.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>At times I can hear the hard disk working away <br>

If swap is not being accessed, you can alleviate firefox disk I/O by visiting <strong>about:preferences</strong> and editing the prefkey <em>browser.cache.disk.parent_directory</em> <br>
(or create a key with that name, if it doesn't already exist)<br>
and supply a tmpfs path for the prefkey value, e.g. <span style="color: blue">/tmp/happyfox</span></div>

<div class="content">Hi again,<br>
<br>
I installed Bleachbit as suggested, no problem and thanks for that. But when using it as ROOT, it asks as usual for the ROOT password but then doesn't recognise it, instead wants the USER account pasword which when supplied it goes away and runs as it should. This is not a problem to me but maybe it's hiding another one?<br>
<br>
I realised what you mean about defining the preferred apps when clicking on a file. I'll have to play with that one when time allows. Again no big deal.<br>
<br>
Is there any way of installing the group of Terminal Apps as a single update or do I have to go through them one by one and set up the menu entries manually ? Can I set them all up as an executable file and run them under bash?<br>
<br>
I have Chromium, Google Chrome and Firefox all installed.and have a distinct preference for non-corporate software which is why I'm here in the first place. What browser do you suggest I use ? I avoid GOOGLE as a search engine but contrariwise I do use GMAIL! I an having trouble with Chromuim, can't get rid of the default GMAIL email accounts on the template, which are my wife's and must have come from something historical, they are located in / home / roland / .config / default / ? but it's an SQL database and therefore I can't edit the texts, nor can I discover how to change them the official way. Any ideas please ?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time, I'm in a tough learning curve.<br>
<br>

<div class="content">The bleachbit password prompt behavior you described is the expected behavior.<br>
Okay, _you_ didn't expect it... I'm just explaining it's not a bug.<br>
You'll find the same (wants YOUR password) when launching sudo-permissioned ControlCenter apps, or Synaptic Package Manager, etc
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>installing the group of Terminal Apps as a single update or do I have to go through them one by one and set up the menu entries manually ? Can I set them all up as an executable file and run them under bash?</div></blockquote>What is"Terminal App"?<br>
You might be referring to custom shell scripts, except... you're asking how to"install" them? Confused.<br>
-=-<br>
"Can I set them all up as an executable file and run them under bash?"<br>
Yes.<br>
-=-<br>
To gain ability to launch via menu, create a .desktop file for each item you want added to the menu, then perform"Update Menus"<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div> What browser do you suggest I use ? </div></blockquote>I won't"suggest". It's a personal decision -- you can try various browsers to decide what best suits YOU.<br>
Maybe some sites you visit (geemail) behave better when using"gbrowser", yet you'll prefer fbrowser (or pbrowser, or qbrowser) for general use?<br>
<br>
"SQL database"<br>
I don't use chrome/chromium, but it's probably storing data in a"sqlite" container.<br>
Editors are available for inspecting/editing sqlite datafiles (no, I don't have specific download links).<br>
IIRC, debian has a"sqliteman" package; I can't recall whether it provides a GUI.<br>
If you do decide to edit, create a backup copy of the datafile.<br>
Also, in case it's not obvious... don't attempt to edit browser-related files while the browser is running.</div>
