<div class="content">Hi Brian,<br>
<br>
I read your blog and this post, and find myself very interested to try antiX-core and get to antiX-Debian-Sid-xfce for some learning.<br>
<br>
This is my first time using antiX core.<br>
In older days M8.5 would not let me get internet on this computer with broadcom BCM57788 NIC.<br>
However the M11 core has 36 kernel and supposedly had broadcom NIC work out of the box, or else I might not even be able to get internel.<br>
<br>
So I just follow your steps .<br>
Woo-Hoo, I cannot believe it: I have the antiX-Debian-Sid-xfce working!

Here are some issues I need some help and some observations I thought would be useful:<br>
<br>
1. I cannot mount any partition and cannot mount USB drive.<br>
When it runs, all partitions show up with ICONS on desktop, USB, CDROM also show up as ICON.<br>
When I click any ICON on any partition, that ICON just disappear and nothing happen<br>
When I click ICON of USB drive, there is a pop up windows with the error<br>
<br>
Failed to mount"8.0 GB Filesystem"<br>

<br>
Here are some terminal data I thought might be helpful

2. I install Synaptic, then install newer kernel 3.0.0-2<br>
However, on reboot, there is no selection to boot with new kernel.<br>
Could be issue with grub legacy used? ( grub2 will usually update and add a selection on menu)<br>
<br>
<br>
3. task-xfce-desktop pull in so many packages!! so the sources.list had become important for reason of download speed, if I choose from a mirror that is closer, I could save lots of time downloading.<br>
The default sources list is us mirror.<br>
Since this is my first trial, if I do it second time, I would be changing the repos to the 'known closer one' to reduce the download time<br>
<br>
4. I did not do apt-get install wicd htop etc, <br>
but it seems task-xfce-desktop pull in wicd and lots of xfce-defaults (iceweasel , brasero, etc...)<br>
or perhaps it was already preloaded in antiX-core?<br>
<br>
5. When I tried to play youtube, the video was not nice, something like a 3:3 aspect ration rather than the 4:3 aspect ratio. I saw one original flash plugin ( cannot remember the version), may be that one did not play well with defaul iceweasel 7.0.1.<br>
So I change the sources list to add non-free , and with that, I could apt-get flashplugin-nonfree, this resolved the flash player issue<br>
<br>
6. Cannot restart ot shutdown from GUI<br>
when I click Application Menu &gt;&gt; Log Out &gt;&gt; a pop up windows show Logout, but Restart and Shutdown are greyed out.<br>
<br>
How could this be resolved?<br>
<br>
At the moment I use root terminal and issue reboot to get system to reboot.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #00FF00">EDIT: just tried logout, then login as root, well, this time Restart, Shutdown, etc appear and I could click shutdown and restart!!</span><br>

4. htop is included in core - the others you mention are not.<br>

Have fun!<br>

Not sure about 1. Maybe you need to install policykit/udisks?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the feedback. It is at least gratifying to see that you were able, using the tutorial, to get a somewhat functional system. That was the goal, so at least that goal was accomplished.<br>
<br>
Regarding 3. The task-xfce-desktop is a large meta package, and it does indeed pull in a LOT of software, arguably more than needed. The trade off is that it is a fast, simple way to get a complete system, but the disadvantage is that it may, as you notice, give you more than you were counting on. An alternative is to use smxi and include the components that you want, but that is a bit more work.<br>

6. Not sure why with your setup you do not see a shutdown or restart option. Whatever I did, I see all of the options available and accessible. I have gone back and changed xdm, which is what I got with the meta package, and replaced it with gdm3; not sure if that is the difference or not.</div>
