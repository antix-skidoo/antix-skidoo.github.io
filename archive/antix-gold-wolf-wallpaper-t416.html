It is available in a version with a flat logo and lettering or a version with a beveled logo and lettering....take your pick. They are large files with the speckling in the wallpaper. The screenshot above shows the flat logo version.<br>

<div class="content">Yes, you've captured the"sakasa quality" (Is that now the"gold standard" of wallpaper?).<br>

But mainly, thanks for getting the file size down. AntiX users often need to conserve diskspace...</div>

<div class="content">Ok....I posted the new improved brown wolf wallpaper. Smaller file sizes and three patterns to choose from. Here is a screenshot of pattern 3 with the"Roots" fluxbox style. I like this much better...the look and the file sizes.<br>
<br>

I think I've done as much damage as I can to this theme. Maybe time to move on. <br>

<div class="content">To: impuwat<br>
<br>
Don't be discorage if you see your votes going down in KDElook.org. It also happens to me. In the last week all my votes have come down, many of the images from 63, 65, and 67% to the 30's and 40's % lately. There is a group or someone intentionally lowing down the % by voting bad, not to you only, to me and to others.<br>
<br>
The voting system in KDE should be siimilar to the allan gabston art community, where you can rate it instead of someone intentionally vote bad so there images can come on top. notice that in the same day you can vote 3 times limit.<br>
<br>
I tell you this in case you have seen your votes coming down as I saw it on your last creation. So it is not to me for judgement everyone is going to have to deal with their own karma and there is no scape.<br>
<br>
To whom it may concern:<br>
<br>
Regarding what I feel about anything that has to do with quality:<br>
<br>
I really appreciate any one comments about me. If it is bad or good. <br>
<br>
I belief that the moment I think I'm great is the moment that I will become limited in whatever creation. <br>
<br>
When I condition myself I become limited in creation.<br>
<br>
Therefore to me think of being great or similar is a limitation to possible greater capacity. <br>
<br>
I am part of this great forum and I'm able to help, to support the forum members. I will alway support anyone from this forum or any human being. I really like, appreciate, respect and admire the work of impuwat.<br>
<br>
I really appreciate your comments I really do. Handshake and best Wishes.</div>

I do give my work to others and I like to share within my own possibilities, specially to this forum. I really appreciate those that have voted for me and that have not vote, but they also download the images and those that don't. The reason I made so many wallpapers is because I like art and I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It makes me feel good to be able to share to people, specially the forum members, which have supported me. <br>

<div class="content">Thanks again for the support and gracious comments. I hadn't really noticed the ratings dropping but just checked and see what you mean. To be honest I'm just having fun...striving for increased knowledge and skill as well as hopefully contributing.<br>
<br>
As a financially struggling college student years ago, I made extra cash as a calligrapher. Everything from favorite quotes to menus for restaurants to illustrative calligraphy for college publications. I rarely pick up a pen these days but enjoy learning the capabilities of Gimp and Inkscape. I like to think as my skill with these programs increases, so will my quality.<br>
<br>
I think the value of ratings is limited. I would rather see a lot of downloads than a high rating. I reckon that if I like and use something I create...someone else might want to use it as well. Royal Red and Eco-Green styles combined are closing in on 4,000 downloads. That is a lot of antiX exposure....and therein is some satisfaction. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
