<div class="content">Good day to everybody. <br>
To make things short, here's a bit of background and what my problems are:<br>
switched three months ago from Windows to 100% open source (this was tough shit and it still is).<br>
On my main box I have Ubuntu 7.10, which I can get working pretty well (for a guy who four months ago would have typed"rm -rf /" in the terminal without blinking). <br>
So.. i'm learning commands, i'm learning arguments a.s.o.<br>
On my small and old laptop (Compaq Armada M700), I have installed antiX, since it has been a praised distro, extremely suitable for a small brain (computer's brain that is), since the laptop only has 128 RAM. And here's where my problems started.<br>
<br>
1) The install went on okie, but there are common commands that i know, use, or read about that I cannon use in antiX (command not found). For example ifconfig, or hwclock. Even though they have manual pages. <br>
2) And this leads me to another problem. In order to access the internet to install packages via Synaptic. I need to change my network card's MAC adress (DHCP server, and will use temporarily the MAC from my main box) a thing I have not seen to be done although i've looked around the internet (albeit not dedicated a GREAT deal of time to the issue). <br>
<br>
I the end I'd like to thank you for the OS, and the forum, and everything, and I know that I am not too adept, and apologize, and hope to get some help to solve the issue. <br>
Many thanks. <br>

<div class="content">Hello and welcome.<br>
<br>
1- Those commands you mention require root privileges. To become root&gt;&gt;in a terminal type su then password and then command.<br>
<br>
2- Not exactly sure what or why you want to do this. Don't both of your machines have internet access? How do you connect?<br>

<div class="content">Oh well.. as said.. being newbie and used to ubuntu it took me a little more than that to figure that as opposed to ubuntu where it says :command X requires root priviledges, here, it only gives you"Command not found". <br>
The MAC is changed now. Must only figure out how to change left button behaviour (pisses me off the on click = open everything).<br>
I need the MAC because the DHCP authenticates via MAC, and the small one won't stay here. I just need the upgrades from the internet. <br>
Many thanks for the quick response. This is something giants like M$ should learn. I bet a similar response from them would have taken at least five registration, got to me in six weeks, and wouldn't do any damn good, because it would be about the non-existent pirated copy of my neighbour that appears in their servers. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">You ca set up Antix to use sudo if you prefer but I really never got why it was used in Ubuntu(and others)<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I understand your issue with dhcp. I only ever seen this sort of set up as a lame attempt at security.<br>
