<div class="content">I have a project that would incorporate combining webserver software which has little to nothing to configure for users, and which would need to be installable on any PC (so regardless of the system's hardware). It's a bit similar to SLAMPP. The project"may" be hosted on Comunes collective, and I might bring some external people to this (AntiX ?) project. <br>
<br>
The goal of the project is to allow people to set up their own WiFi or internet-based server easily. With"server" I mean a server that would<br>
run MySQL, PHP, Perl, ..., and a range of internet applications (phpBB, MediaWiki, ...) An example of a website with a selection of services that would be run can be found at 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://aeprojects.tk/"<br>linktext was:"http://aeprojects.tk/"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Off course, the topic of the forums, and other services can be freely chosen off course (xhtml page and content can be changed to cover any topic). For example, if one wishes to distribute knowledge of sailing or tying knots, a private WiFi server can be put up at a marina, ...<br>
<br>
There are some things however that I feel need to be made better with AntiX, to perform equally well as"very lightweight" Linux distro's like SliTaz:<br>
<br>
* the ability to run the OS from RAM (after loading in from a USB stick), see 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions_that_run_from_RAM"<br>linktext was:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Li ... n_from_RAM"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
* perhaps removing packages so that in stead of several hundreds of mb's in filesize, it becomes much lower (I actually even intent to have the entire OS fit on a USB stick (live USB stick), rather than a cd or dvd (live cd or dvd); by comparison, Slitaz takes up only 42 mb or so (without the<br>
packages, the latter which are also 3 gig in size) See 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.slitaz.org/en/about/"<br>linktext was:"http://www.slitaz.org/en/about/"<br>====================================<br>
 Note that if this won't work (which I suspect, a USB harddisk can be used to eliminate the filesize problem).<br>
<br>
The intent is to use 2 usb sticks, one being the usb stick -or usb harddisk- with the OS (non-writable, user permissions blocking writing), and another usb stick to store files on (writable). Note that the usb stick/hd with the OS is only used to load in the OS, the OS would then be read from RAM. RAM usage is about 192 mb with SliTaz, so should be similar to AntiX too.<br>
<br>
So, I wanted to ask: is there any support for such a project here, and is there support for making a personal server"flavour/remixe" as suggested ?<br>
<br>
Personally, I think that for niche OS' like the personal server version I propose -not the main/general purpose version !-, payment can be done by users to the AntiX community, which could give incentive to people to continue developing AntiX. Payment can be done, while keeping it free/open source, by simply allowing download after joining a"AntiX" foundation, ... (for which joining would imply placing a donation first before being allowed to join). Also, by making the OS to have drivers standardly for specific WiFi antenna/access point equipment, ... There's a good possibility of a cooperation with FOSS-friendly shops like ThinkPenguin, ...<br>
<br>
PS: perhaps that some suggestions from following articles can also be implemented to the suggested AntiX flavor:<br>

<div class="content">What you propose doesn't require a"project", just a bit of elbow grease on your part.<br>
<br>
Boot the antiX live from pendrive and setup root persistence (semi-automatic).<br>
On subsequent boots, choose RootPersistence boot option. Add/remove whatever packages you wish...<br>
...and when you're ready (and have read the antiX docs) you can, from a live session, remaster your 'flavoure' <br>
(or whatever you call it) ~~ writing it to another pendrive and/or outputting a customized iso.<br>
<br>
I don't follow the"improve by.. removing packages to fit on a USB drive" reasoning.<br>
It's a non-issue. Any USB drive (pendrive) you grab off the shelf nowadays will have MORE storage capacity than a CD or DVD.<br>
<br>
Booted from pendrive, there's really little benefit to be achieved by"running the O/S from RAM".<br>
<br>
Go ahead, install XAMPP then pre-install whichever web-native applications you intend for your prospective users.<br>
Go ahead, round up links to docs covering phpMyadmin and each of the apps you've preselected.<br>
Go ahead, setup an administrative interface, ala webmin, to enable your users to"easily" administer the web applications.<br>
Configuring the software firewall appropriately will be your responsibility.<br>
Advising users to connect their"server" from behind a NAT wifi-enabled router will be your responsibility.<br>
Advising your users to keep the installed web apps up-to-date (as patches are released to address newly discovered exploits/vulnerabilities) will be your responsibility.<br>
<br>
If you're looking to assemble a project"team" because you are not up to the task of shouldering such responsibility... then your intended users<br>
would be better served if you chose an existing"app suite" solution. No, OwnCloud doesn't quite fit the bill for what you've described,<br>
and IMO webmin is kinda sucky, but certainly some existing"easy webadmin" project which will fullfills most of your requirements exists.<br>
<br>
By the way, the example use case you presented (serve content to folks within wi-fi range of a marina?) is sort of weak.<br>
Consider adding dyndns.org dynamic DNS into the mix. That would open a wider range of usage possibilities.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome to antiX, BrianPerry.<br>
<br>
I guess the version of antiX you are trying out is the full version (c700MB). It also comes in base (c400MB) and core (c135MB) versions that may satisfy your needs better. base comes with X, core without.<br>
<br>
All antiX flavours are able to run in RAM. We also have easy to set up persistence and remastering tools.</div>

Yes, but that would make a distro that I would need a lot of maintenance. Isn't it possible to make a so-called"meta-package" that takes advantage of regular AntiX updates, and just contains the differences between the main AntiX version -I presume a particular version thereof, so in this case say AntiX 13- and the version on how I intent it be to (including some additional packages, altered appearance, ...)<br>

Internet access is not foreseen to be always available; actually in most cases, it won't be made available. Internet access sharing too won't be presumed to be always available.<br>

I believe that what Skidoo suggested is the easiest method. AntiX is Debian based so whatever set of packages you choose to have installed can be updated easily via the"apt" programs.<br>
<br>
Our live-remaster program makes it extremely easy for you to permanently update your LiveUSB with whatever selection of packages you want. After you do a live-remaster, just copy the files from you LiveUSB to other usb sticks (and run extlinux) to clone the version you created.<br>
<br>
We also tried to make it relatively easy for you to make your own respin (flavour) but this will take more work on your part. One benefit of this approach is you can make both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Eino made a

 using our tools.<br>
<br>
I suggest you do it Skidoo's way first. Start with antiX core, base, or full then add and remove packages as you will. If you want to maintain changes across reboots then you should first enable root persistence. Once you have the system tweaked exactly like you want, do a live-remaster. As anticapitalista suggested, if you don't want X then start with core, otherwise start with base.<br>
<br>
You will be hard pressed to find a distro that makes this easier than antiX does.</div>

<div class="content">I got a little further with figuring things out.<br>
First of all for the approach: making an iso or immediately a USB stick with the imbedded tool sounds good, but I really want to be able to take benefit from the general antix updates, without needing to remake the flavor every time a new antix update comes out. Also, I obviously want to share the flavor I made to others, so download size is best low, which can be best accomplished with just sending the packages and a script rather than a full distro.<br>
<br>
I have a bit of a problem with my screen which is a Syncmaster SA10 without screen adjustment buttons. The screen resolution is always incorrect in linux distros and changing it requires me to use the menu, which is often unreachable (stuck in a corner I can't see due to resolution being incorrect). I found that LXDE and box-type window managers (Slitaz's e17/JWM, Openbox, ...) also still allow me to fix the issue every time I boot. Others may encounter this problem too, so I'm preferring LXDE or Box-type window managers. I took a look at some other lightweight distros and found that I actually prefer LXDE, but then again Openbox, ... is way faster, so for server applications, I'll use that (and I found Antix to be the most lightweight/best for this). For general users though, I find Porteus and LXLE nicer (so I might potentially use that for the computers making use of the server PC).<br>
<br>
I was also wondering: the idea is to load the OS from a USB stick into the RAM and run that from there (this way, boot manager/dual booting problems are avoided, especially for non-experienced computer users). Does Antix provide support to use linux-swap partitions to be used when the RAM gets full; I've had some freezes/crashes with Porteus -oddly enough not with LXLE despite being way more heavy-, so perhaps it might be a good idea to support this with Antix (although it will allready be far lighter than Porteus regardless). Since hard disk space is very cheap (unlike RAM) and most hard disks are very large nowadays anyway, a huge speed/stability increase could be attained, for almost no financial cost. <br>
<br>
For making the window manager a bit nicer (I prefer an OS X-like"dock" in the bottom center of the screen), I found that themes can be made for Fluxbox (see styles at 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.fluxbox.org/download/"<br>linktext was:"http://www.fluxbox.org/download/"<br>====================================<br>
 ), so I can make a theme and upload it, or improve an existing theme even. That can be bundled with the packages/script.<br>
<br>
For the packages/script: does the package manager allow to chose a local location to get packages ? If so, the method may work, perhaps even without a script.<br>
<br>
Another thing I want to ask is whether I can scrap packages allready on Antix so as to make it faster/more minimalistic by adding rm-commands in the script mentioned (or I can simply build it from an allready slimmed down flavor, i.e. core version, ...) ? The non-essential packages (which I find still more or less beneficial to have, say programs like the GIMP, OpenOffice, ...) can then be put on the hard disk instead. This should speed things up (as usb stick and HD are then more effectively used, reducing bandwith requirements of these devices) and the system will also boot faster. Also by simply having some things I found not necessary removed completely, the menu also becomes easier to use. To do this in practice, I suppose I can just add these programs in my downloadable flavor package, and add a text stating they need to copy the program folder to a location on their hard disk. They can then install the programs from there (making sure the menu launch location data are made correctly, to avoid having dead launch links in the menu)</div>

<div class="content">antix will use whatever swap partition is available on a device, by default. so if a swap partition is available, antix will use it. you don't have to do anything.<br>
<br>
the"base" version of antiX comes with just fluxbox, so you may want to start there. there is also a right click desktop menu in the default icewm antiX full desktop, so you should be covered there as well.</div>

I guess your"project" would be slightly different in that it runs from a USB stick. To be honest you'll have to spell out the use case of this server as I don't see one at all.<br>

Everything has moved on in leaps and bounds since then. Low administration, simple to deploy, home server software and tiny, portable, low configuartion web servers exist (Amahi and XAMMP). Storage hardware has increased exponentially! My five year old USB stick has a larger capacity than a DVD @ 8GB and now I can buy one 8 times larger for no money at all.

 it seems to me that a working internet connection is needed (either for general operation, or just for install). Internet connection isn't assumed to be available with every personal server in this project.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of using Piratebox instead, see

XFCE is much more heavy, and I like the server to be as fast as possible. Fluxbox is my choice.<br>

I guess your"project" would be slightly different in that it runs from a USB stick. To be honest you'll have to spell out the use case of this server as I don't see one at all.
</div></blockquote>
The main reason is that most people are familiar with Windows, and would tend to thus also use a windows server. This project guides people to using Linux (which will also allow them to use older equipment, which is one of the core reasons why AntiX was created btw), but changing to Linux does mean that people are at risk of erasing data accidentally, and people are also not keen on change in general.Avoiding the need of using a boot loader is hence vital with this process, and this can be done with a USB stick (and mere changing of the boot sequence at the BIOS, which is harmless).<br>
<br>
It is true though that once people have fully converted to Linux, and no longer have Windows software/data they need to access, there may be a benefit in having an install option which could further speed things up (not by that much I assume though, if running from RAM anyway). So the install could still be an option and used later-on by users.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>spaceman wrote:</cite>

</div></blockquote>
I don't think so; I would agree if all files (content that would be broadcasted, so not the files of the OS itself) would be on the USB stick, and if the USB stick would not be used to load the files into RAM and then run the OS from RAM. As such, the booting would be slower as when the OS would be loaded from a hard disk (frugal install), but in operation, speed would be the same as with a frugal install.<br>

Not everyone has broadband. In developing worlds, satellite internet access would often be used btw, which isn't that fast. Also, tinyness also benefits the speed of operation, important with older computers.<br>

Not everyone has 300 GBP lying around to spend on this. Also, besides many people that simply don't have the money or which are willing to spend on this, it also benefits the environment as older PC's can be used and made to service untill they effectively break down.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>spaceman wrote:</cite>

</div></blockquote>
Raspberry Pi's are ARM based, and I'm not entirely sure whether Fedora/Amahi can be run on these as you suggest. Regardless, Piratebox does have a Raspberry Pi version, so servers can be made with it. The main benefit of this will be the lower cost compared to a PC (in the event no 2nd hand computers are available in your location, which is unlikely) and the lower power consumption compared to a PC. So that's an option, but I would only promote it as a fall-back option, not the primary route on how to make this personal server.</div>

<div class="content">I understand now Brian. You're trying to design an ultra cheap, simple to deploy, simple to configure server built on Linux and second-hand hardware. The"server" is intended to be available on an occasional ad hoc basis and runs from a USB pendrive so that the administrator doesn't have to disturb their old PCs primary operating system. Your target audience appears to be: Windows users with no Linux experience; poorer communities in the developing world; people with no interest or funds to invest in dedicated server technologies; people who do want network hosted community services, like Mediawiki or phpBB, available over geographically limited wireless network that reaches a few metres, say in a pub or community hall. The target audience will also have no internet connection and will receive no support for their slow and limited shoe string server. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
antiX was designed for older hardware? Really? You'll be telling me it's based on Debian next. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I decided to use the base version; the core version needs to be build first.</div></blockquote>
Yes, you're right you need to type at the command line...2 or 3 lines.<br>
sudo apt-get install xorg<br>
sudo apt-get install slim (or other login manager of your choice - optional)<br>
sudo apt-get install fluxbox (or other DE of your choice)<br>
<br>
Et viola, a GUI. I love Core - nothing unwanted to rip out. A server shouldn't really waste resources on a GUI, btw. Maybe an administrative web interface....starting to sound familiar again. Also, love antiX as I do, it's based on Debian Testing and, like Arch, it's designed to be rolling. A good choice for a server? Then again most desktop distros aren't ideal server platforms and I use Fedora. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
I think the demand for your old USB stick server will be incredibly high. Best of luck. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">In this post, I'll give details of all the changes I wish to do.<br>
I will re-update/re-edit this post as many times as needed.<br>
<br>
In the text file in annex, the general details of the changes needed are given.<br>
In the image in annex, you'll see how I intent to have the appearance changed. Note that the theme will be changed too (to the theme mentioned in the text file). However, the main reason I posted the image is to show that there will now be a dock used at the bottom (similar to OS X), and it will have an apps-button. The apps button has no subdivisions (so less programs can be put in the bar, which forces us to limit the apps in the OS. It also immediately allows to spot and remove the double links -there were many in the antix base version- and make it easier to use. If there are not enough apps that can be placed in the apps button, a second apps button can be placed next to the first apps button.<br>
<br>
One optional thing that can also be done with the appearance would be to eliminate the minimise/maximise button in the windows and only having a resize window (allowing to then pull on the edges of the window after clicking it) and a close button on the windows. Also, the minimising to taskbar option can be completely removed as well (so besides simply removing the buttons). The idea is to hence force people to using their desktops/desktop buttons more effectively (utilising all desktops, rather than only 1 or 2). Besides this, people will also open up less new windows for a program and use the tabs inside an existing same program more (for example with the browser window). This should hence also have a positive effect on the speed of the computer. The idea can be seen on this image:<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Improved_UMPC_design#mediaviewer/File:KK_OS.png"<br>linktext was:"https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Improve ... :KK_OS.png"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
(I btw also based my desktop image below on this image)<br>
<br>
For some programs, I'm not yet sure, see viewtopic.php?f=49&amp;t=5315<br>
<br>
Besides these visual/program changes, the boot menu too would be changed, see viewtopic.php?f=49&amp;t=5310<br>
<br>
The update to the antix keyboard could also be done (see viewtopic.php?f=49&amp;t=5311 ) but it isn't essential (should just be mentioned in help how change can be done to a specific keyboard layout using ROXterm)<br>
<br>
Perhaps that the ability to put shortcuts on the desktop can be disabled entirely. That way, the right click menu options (desktop --&gt; roxpinboard on/off and spacefm desktop on/off, conky on/off ) can be eliminated, and conky can be made non-removable. The idea is to, instead of using the desktop to place shortcuts on, it can be used to only show system information, and perhaps information from online sources -when connected to the internet- These online information can be for example news from CNN, ... showing it in a sort of"news headlines ticker", ... I got the idea after seeing some desktops at

 <br>
<br>
The personal server packages can either be made available as a metapackage (which can then be installed by the user, and he can then make a new antix version himself which has these packages, by using antix2usb, remasterCC, ... OR we can make a second iso. Perhaps that either the first or second iso can be placed at the antix sourceforge page (that is, if it becomes as good as I hope, and anticapitalista agrees)<br>
<br>
The personal server packages should include the piratebox software (see 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://piratebox.cc/laptop"<br>linktext was:"http://piratebox.cc/laptop"<br>====================================<br>
 ) and additional software that is also present in XAMPP/AMPPS (to be able to provide MySQL and PHP support, hence allowing to run the aeprojects.tk site locally). Additionally,<br>
XOWA and Java support needs adding, as well as an instant messenger and/or IRC server package; more details on the latter can be found in the text file in WLANandcommunic.zip<br>
This WLANandcommunic.zip file btw also has an image with an alternative setup (the main setup would simply be a"piratebox"/OpenWRT router -such as the TP-Link MR3020/MR3040, see 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://piratebox.cc/openwrt:diy"<br>linktext was:"http://piratebox.cc/openwrt:diy"<br>====================================<br>
 ), to allow building larger/cheaper WLAN networks. It does this by combining a bridge with multiple access points (called"WiFi or WiMax antennas in the longhouse_inside_description.txt) This setup should also be supported. I'm not sure whether this is automatically supported in Linux, or whether additional packages need to be installed for this.<br>
<br>
The aeprojects.tk website, as well as some other content that might be included herein later-on, can be downloaded from <span data-s9e-mediaembed="googledrive" style="display:inline-block;width:100%;max-width:640px"><span style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%"><iframe allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/0BwSad-yeUXuXX2ExSlZEMzFOUjg/preview" style="border:0;height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;width:100%"></iframe></span></span> The files are in the"unrelated to XOWA" folder. The files are zipped and quickparred, so un-quickpar and unzip first. For unquickparring in linux, see the text file in annex to this post (mentioned some programs for this).<br>
<br>
Perhaps that the option of storing programs on a location on the harddisk without affecting the OS files itself can also be added. Full details of this idea can be found here: post37917.html<br>
<br>
Perhaps that later-on, additional programs and perhaps the drive letter swapping mentioned in 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Linux_adaptations_for_UMPC_design"<br>linktext was:"https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Linux_a ... MPC_design"<br>====================================<br>
 can also be added (the last seems unlikely though, since it might be difficult to realize in practice and could give much problems with many programs, updating of kernel, ...)<br>
<br>
PS: note that I forgot to mention 1 extra suitable WLAN instant messenger in longhouse_inside_description.txt , namely Ekiga.</div>
