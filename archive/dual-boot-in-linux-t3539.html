<div class="content">Hi this is my first post ,<br>
<br>
I have been using LInux in its various incarnations now for some time and love it ( sorry though not as much as OS X). Got it installed on work laptop ( they dont know oopps) and it is sooooo much better that Windows.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have played with the usual distros Ubuntu, Mint etc and really like them, however, i have a HP 2133 that i had lying around and found these distros very slow. so started looking for an alternative.<br>
<br>
I cam across Mepis 11 and installed it on my HP Notebook and while it works ok it can be a bit slow, ( Note book spec HP has 700mhz Via C7-M, 1GB and a very healthy 160GB hard drive)<br>
<br>
I stumbled upon Antix last night and thought thats nice and light, and was wondering if like in Ubuntu, where you can instal Gnome or KDE from within Ubuntu. Can this also be done in my current installation of Mepis or do i need to reinstall Mepis and Antix on 2 seperate partitions.<br>
<br>
I hope i am making myself clear, i was able within Ubuntu to switch between 2 different setups by logging out of one and then into the other..<br>
<br>
<br>
Many thanks<br>
<br>
<br>
I have searched the forums for the answer but i cant seem to find anything.<br>

<div class="content">There are alternate desktops available for Mepis (you might want to check out mepislovers.org for more mepis-specific topics). antix is stand-alone though so you would need a stand-alone install. Part of what makes mepis slower on older machines is the KDE desktop. You may want to simply try a different desktop environment (LXDE) or go window-manager only like in antix (icewm or fluxbox). These should appear in mepis's package manager. Mepis and Antix are both based on debian, so anything available for debian should be available for mepis and antix. looking at that older machines specs, I would lean more towards the antix install than changing up mepis though. 700mhz via c7 is certainly not very fast, but they are very power efficient. I've got antix running on a 900 mhz amd duron laptop, and except for an extended boot time, it runs great on only 512 mb of ram.</div>
