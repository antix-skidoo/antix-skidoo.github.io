<div class="content">Hello!<br>
I posted this here, as I am a new user of AntiX. I intalled it last night on an old machine I use mostly for listening to music. So a minimalist, lightwight distro like AntiX pretty much does the job, so I like it there. (of course, after I found out how to"fix" the Broadcom wireless intermittence issue...)<br>
<br>
So now that I set up most of the important stuff I need, I would like to have remote access to the desktop (GUI) of the AntiX machine from my other (Ubuntu) machine.<br>
I have tried both vnc4server and vino, but no luck... On the client side, I have Vinagre on an Ubuntu 12.04 system. I must confess I don't really understand how does it work. :-/ In Ubuntu (I was using Xubuntu before AntiX on that machine) it is all set up by default, so one has just to run vino-preferences and say to it how to share the desktop. In AntiX this is not as easy...<br>
<br>
Is there anybody who could give some step by step instructions? What shoud I install? What shoud I run? How to set i it all up?<br>
<br>
I already tried to"google" it, but haven't found anything really usable... So I gave up and finally decided to ask here. Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">OK... Answering to myself... Anyway, I found out how to do it. With both vnc4server AND vino. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> But I prefer Vino, because it gives me control over the machine's own desktop, not just a virtual one. And that is what I was really looking for: basically a remote control for my music set. But then again, the possibilties are not limited to that, of course. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
So, unlike Xfce (or Xubuntu), IceWM (or antiX) doesn't run the vino server automatically when running vino-preferences. So the whole trouble was really to manually start the vino server, by running in a terminal (or in gExec, but anyway, NOT AS ROOT):"/usr/lib/vino/vino-server &amp;"<br>
<br>
And that's it! Then you can run Vinagre, or whatever VNC client you prefer, and connect right away to that desktop.<br>
Vinagre is cool because it has a search feature for the local network, so you don't have to write the whole IP address or whatever... just click the server you want to connect to.<br>
Remmina is also very nice, faster and more advanced than Vinagre, but it lacks the search feature and, more importantly for me, it doesn't support the mouse's scroll wheel in the remote dektop... or at least I don't know how to get it. :-/<br>
<br>
Well, I hope somebody will benefit of this post one day... :-p<br>
<br>
Thank you, anyway. If for nothing else, then for the nice distro. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

You could add your command to the iceWM startup file and it would automatically load each time you boot. That is assuming you want the server running all the time.<br>
<br>
antixcc &gt; Edit IceWM Settings &gt; startup<br>
<br>
<br>
I do use vinagre myself to connect via RDP to a Windows7 print and file server.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I was thinking about it, too. But then I came to conclusion that I don't really need it all the time... so I think I will rather make a launcher.<br>
But of course, the startup file is a good solution too, dependantly on one's particular needs. Good you mentioned it.</div>
