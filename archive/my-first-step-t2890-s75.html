<div class="content">By the way, I'd like to tell you something.<br>
<br>
The issue I had with antiX that was so surprising, it wasn't only with antiX, I got the same issue with:<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>Ubuntu 10.04 (on two different PCs)<br>
Ubuntu Studio 10.04<br>
Lubuntu 10.04 </strong></span><br>
<br>
I was searching and I found this:<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1152619"<br>linktext was:"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1152619"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
What fixed the issue with the above mentioned distributions was:<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo apt-get update -o Acquire::http::No-Cache=True</code></pre></div>
and if not then<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo apt-get update -o Acquire::BrokenProxy=true</code></pre></div>
Now, sadly that fixed the issue temporary. Once I shutdown and turn on the next day, I have to repeat that again.<br>
<br>
I tried:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>apt-get clean</code></pre></div>
then
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>apt-get update</code></pre></div>
but did not work.<br>
<br>
Then I tried this:<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 437D05B5
sudo apt-get update</code></pre></div>
but nothing worked.<br>
<br>
Only the two above commands:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo apt-get update -o Acquire::http::No-Cache=True</code></pre></div>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sudo apt-get update -o Acquire::BrokenProxy=true</code></pre></div>
were very helpful.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #FF0000">Mainly, this is the error message I got with the above listed distributions:</span><br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>W: GPG error: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com lucid-security Release: The following signatures were invalid: BADSIG 40976EAF437D05B5 Ubuntu Archive Automatic Signing Key &lt;ftpmaster@ubuntu.com&gt;

</code></pre></div>
What is going on and why it's happening? I have no idea!<br>
Why it works for a while then when I shutdown and turn on again, I got the same error? I have no idea!<br>
My experience with Linux is still fresh (few months old) so it seems I can't find a good reason of what's going on.<br>
<br>
Just thought to let you know. So, I guess it's not an antiX problem, looks like it has something to do with another issue.</div>

<div class="content">So sorry that these problems had to catch you right now, just as you are giving this software a good look. Believe me, keyring issues, while they show up occasionally, are not at all common. If and when they happen, they are far more likely around two particular events: releases and keyring expiration. I believe that a few keys may have recently expired. However, there does seem to be some corruption out there that is affecting some people. That optional argument for turning off the cache access is handy, and that shows that something may be incorrect in the existing cache, but it is quite strange that cleaning the cache doesn't get rid of the problem.<br>
<br>
As you mention, sitting and waiting for the new release is probably a good thing. I am so sorry about all of this. I assure you that when all of the release dust settles, you will find antiX to be an outstanding distribution. I hope we've been cordial enough to you that you will come back and sample the release as soon as it is available! Meanwhile, take care, and feel free to stop by and read various posts in the forum. Perhaps some reading over the next few weeks will prove to be quite useful as you start to learn Linux. I recommend both our Wiki and our manual, which you can find navigating from the main site.</div>

It's okay masinick, very nice of you <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

I believe you and it's very good to know that. I thought there is another reason, a 3rd reason beside the two events you mentioned.<br>

Is there any way to turn the cache off? first of all, from what I understand so far (sorry, didn't read about it yet) is when we do:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>apt-get update</code></pre></div>
means we're trying to synchronize"sources.list" file with the server (repositories) to keep it up-to-date. Am I right?<br>
So, when we say"cache", is it another file or it's sources.list? <br>

Hey, I'm not giving up on antiX nor any other distribution <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
I had some problems with Fedora and SliTaz people but I'm just taking a break from both. I'll go back once they'll have new release <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
I even post on Ubuntu's Forum and Fedora's Forum. I told them that antiX's Forum is THE BEST ever <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
So, I'm here <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Perhaps some reading over the next few weeks will prove to be quite useful as you start to learn Linux. I recommend both our Wiki and our manual, which you can find navigating from the main site.</div></blockquote>
Yes, reading is good and that's one of the good things Linux has changed in my life. I hate reading but that's history. I love it now <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
However, I have a different approach in learning. I'm playing with Lubuntu at the moment. I don't have antiX anymore but once you guys will release the new version, I'm going to try it for sure.<br>
<br>
I'm new to Linux so the more distribution I try, the more I'll understand. So far, GNOME is my favorite but I'd like to learn more about the other WMs.<br>
<br>
Thank you for being so nice and helpful and I'll be around, don't worry <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
