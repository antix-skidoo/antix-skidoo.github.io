<div class="content">First, thanks to"Management" for kindly accepting my Registration request - and good-day to all <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
(sorry this post is a bit long <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Problem:<br>
1. I downloaded antiX-M11-486.iso and antiX-M11-486.iso.md5sum from a mirror - but can't discover how to do the verification: if someone could please lead (in very easy steps please) I would be very grateful <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Note: I got the following info in the process:<br>
antix hash value - ref. linux tracker.org = ad39fadea8befab9278c620b999a80708ab7db23<br>
File size - ref.Windows 'Properties' = 678 MB (710,934,528 bytes)<br>
<br>
I repeated the downloads a second time and did a FC: filename a filename b /b comparison in Windows XP (command line):"no differences detected". That tells me that the transmissions were both identical - but not whether the files on the mirror were uncorrupted.<br>
<br>
2. I downloaded winMd5sum and input both antiX-M11-486.iso files (separately) and both gave the same hash value - but NOT that given above. ( I had difficulty understanding quite how to use the winMd5sum utility and understand there might be other similar programs).<br>
<br>
3: Background: I am trying to upgrade an old 4gb Thinkpad (without a web-connection- yet) to Linux and my reaserch is progressing on my Windows XP Gateway laptop: hence I can't access linux commands to perform this verification (FYI). <br>
I want to create a bootable USB stick to fully try-out antix-M11 before I finally install: I don't think 2GB free space is enough to create a dual-boot system with Win98(existing).<br>
Both the Gateway and Thinkpad have a DVD drive, but I don't think the Thinkpad can read a dvd disc 'Burnt' iso file (and I don't have a blank cd) - hence I want to get the Antix iso directly onto a USB stick using the Gateway: (and I couldn't find"antix2usb" or anything about that 'program'(?) ).<br>
I have downloaded the program"unetbootin-win-549.exe" which I think gets me directly from a downloaded iso to a USB stick from within Windows: could anyone please comment+<br>
<br>
I'm NOT a geek (of any kind) - just a WindowsXP old fart: so if you would please assume nothing and speak to me in babytalk (as respects Linux) I would be grateful <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span>)<br>
<br>
Kind regards, and thanks, granisalo</div>

<div class="content">Hi <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I don't think 2GB free space is enough to create a dual-boot system with Win98(existing).</div></blockquote>
You're right. My Full install on my 4 gig ssd Asus EEEPC 900 Netbook weighed in over 2 gig after install. You will also probably need to make a /swap partition on that Windows 98 Laptop ,as since I don't know your ram specs for it. <br>
<br>
So no 2 gig won't cut the mustard.<br>
<br>
Kinda confused about your md5sum checks. winmd5sum is a pretty simple md5sum checker which I have used back when I used Windows to check linux md5sums. Seemed pretty straightforward to me and I am just a biker, not a programmer.<br>
<br>
When I used it. I just copied and pasted the antiX md5sum that was downloaded from site into top Window (blank box)<br>
<br>
Then used the button next to the bottom blank box to load the iso file that was downloaded. Then run the check to see if they matched.<br>
<br>
I'll also be surprised if that Windows 98 laptop will boot usb from the bios without help from something like a PLOP boot floppy also. <br>
<br>
Hope my post is simple enough for you to understand. <br>
<br>
Happy Trails, Rok</div>

<div class="content">i don't get any redirects on my part. i had this problem some time ago with this warning and i disabled it.<br>
open firefox's preferences &gt; advanced &gt; general &gt; accessibility and uncheck [ ] Warn me when web sites try to redirect or reload the page<br>
because the antix forum is hosted on a free host with ads i don't know what wants to redirect you. it could be anything. the chat is refreshed every 60 seconds so maybe this is the culprit. a little reading on this feature of firefox

<div class="content">192MB of ram is not a whole heck of a lot to run AntiX graphical installer. Before you run the GUI installer. I would make a /swap file with Gparted of about 400 MB of ram. That will keep the graphical installer from freezing or hanging up during the install process.<br>
<br>
Up to you though. I really don't see how you will be able to keep Windows 98 and install AntiX 11 Full Iso. Maybe core would install though I am not sure and you being new to Linux. I would not recommend a core iso or base iso install because you will be lost in the woods because of certain included tools that come in full iso will be missing. Plus you sound like command line install will be too deep of waters for you to swim in. Just my opinion though. I could be wrong in my assumption. No insult to you. <br>
<br>
Believe it or not. I am probably the only long time AntiX member that comes close to relating<br>
on how lost you are (remember, I am just a motorcycle biker). I was a young penguin when I first booted AntiX and was lost in the water. I had to read a lot of manuals and understand what I was reading before I became proficient/comfortable enough to swim into the deep depths of command line and understand and interpet members posts when replying to my questions. <br>
<br>
A lot of answers here will be in linux command short speak. You will have to broaden your brain abit to learn a new language. Nothing worth having is easy. The knowledge I have gained from members and developer here plus his distro has been invaluable to me and has made me a better and smarter person than I was before using this distro. It has been life changing for me.<br>
<br>
AntiX is a lean and mean Distro. It uses command line editing for certain problems instead of a lot of gui stuff for fixing certain hardware problems so you will be getting a lot of command line replies. Just the nature of the beast. Most lightweight Linux operating systems that run on low spec hardware like yours requires this, to be able to run on low spec hardware like yours.<br>
<br>
Enough gushing.<br>
<br>
After you get the md5sum correct/sorted out.<br>
<br>
Make a bootable pendrive in Windows XP with something like LILi<br>

<br>
<br>
Make sure land line ethernet is connected before powering on.<br>
<br>
Select pendrive to boot from bios after powering on Windows 98 laptop. (I hope you are not misinterpreting your pendrive boot in bios. I have seen this happen before). My Amrel shows pendrive boot in bios after I upgraded bios. But it was for any pendrive (USB-FDD, USB-ZIP, USB-CDROM) other than just a USB pendrive. Which meant it would not boot a pendrive. Below link might help though if bios matches.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Select from grub menu any boot menu you would like to try out. If it fails. reboot. Try another menu option.<br>
<br>
Once you get to Desktop. Run it live to see how speedy you are on 192MB of ram.<br>
Open Iceape Browser and check youtube and sound. Turn up the sound with volume icon in taskbar all the way up also.<br>
<br>
Test drive while running live first. Open a terminal. It's in the taskbar.<br>
<br>
Type in <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>inxi -F</code></pre></div>
copy and come here and post output and paste it in your next post so members can see what hard ware you are using and can make further suggestions on what to do next.<br>
<br>
While in terminal. Type in <br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sux</code></pre></div>
hit enter. password name is (type in)<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>root</code></pre></div> nothing will show when you type in password. It is a security feature in case anyone is looking over your shoulder.<br>
Hit enter. <br>
<br>
Type in next<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>fdisk -l</code></pre></div> -l is lower case L. Linux is case sensitive by the way.<br>
<br>
Copy and paste into next post also. When copying and pasting terminal readouts in forum. Go to advanced post feature on forum and use the Code tags from task bar in reply window like i did replying to this thread. Just makes it easier to read readouts and keeps me from editing posts later (I am the kitty litter cleaner and dog poop picker upper at home also )<br>

Thnx for your comprehensive response and sorry mine is a bit late <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
I was about to study it but ran out of time. When I tried sometime later, I just couldn't log-on. Tried the <br>

seems OK again <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>

I'm about ready to try and get the Iso onto the stick and want to study your instructions before I post back: <br>

<br>
You can use the Gparted screenshots I posted for reference for making a /swap partition of about 400MB before running the installer. Since you say you can boot off of USB. You can keep Windows 98 on the internal 4 gig drive. Which means you can run AntiX 11 persistent usb using antix2usb tool off of external<br>
Pendrive and dual boot by changing boot order in bios when wanting to run Windows from internal drive. Then change bios boot order again to boot off of USB.<br>
<br>
To confuse you even further. To boot off of USB on a old USB 1.1 laptop. You will need to add rootdelay=20 at the grub window that shows when AntiX boots up. Just type it in when splash window for Grub bootloader shows. This gives time for the usb to be found by grub on a slow usb 1.1 port on old laptops.</div>

<div class="content">Grani to Roky - come in Roky !!!<br>
<br>
Thanks for your continuing efforts Rok - really appreciated: looks like you've got the bit between your teeth <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
But - am I red-faced or what <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
I think you may have"jumped-the-gun" (to follow your metaphor) in trying to be so helpful so quickly - but I'm grateful !!!<br>
<br>
Guess what? - I think my head is on the wrong way round: I shouln't be allowed out alone <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
I would have sworn and sworn again that I had checked the Thinkpad Bios for USB boot in the list: nope, God damn it, it ain't in the list!!! Geez, am I mad! (it is in the Gateway - of course - that's only a couple of years old).<br>
So not quite sure how relevant your last (very detailed) instructions are now.<br>
<br>
Here's where i am right now.<br>
<br>
1. I got the Antix-M11 iso on to an empty 2gb Fat32 stick using unetbootin. It seemed to go OK (as far as I can tell: there was no mention in unetbootin (as I recall) about whether the stick had been prepared (if that is required before loading the iso). I'm unclear as to whether the antix iso is already"prepared" for booting or whether one has to make the stick (or CD/DVD) bootable BEFORE the iso is loaded thereon: (this is is all 'a very dark art <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> )<br>
2. Anyway, I stuck de stick in de hole (as one does <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> and the Thinkpad promptly booted into Windoze: er? waz up ?<br>
thats when I looked again at the Bios - and swore !!!<br>
3. So, I tried it in the Gateway - black screen with a cursor: er? waz up ??? I moved up 'Boot from USB' in the Bios - still nothing <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> - hence my question above about the necessity (or otherwise) of preparing the stick to be bootable before putting on the iso. (I'll bet you're sorry you bothered now Rok aren't you??? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span>))<br>
4. OK, I'd like to get the stick usable on the Gateway - if pos, but first need to use a disc in the Thinkpad - question is how.<br>
5. I've got a DVD-R with some stuff on it (using DeepBurner1_Portable on the Gateway - if I remember - long time ago).<br>
I'd like to fill-up that disc if possible, but if not I have another clean DVD-R disc I can use.<br>
6. According to the manual, the ThinkPad has a"5.25–inch, 2X speed, E-IDE inter-face DVD-ROM drive" so I'm wondering if that will be able to read a bootable antix DVD-R disc created on the Gateway (not too sure yet how <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
7. So Roky, if I said pretty, pretty, pretty pleeeeze, do you think you might find it in your heart to stop me spinning around and kindly 'point me in the right direction' ???? - pleeeezzzzzz??? - oh, don't forget, baby steps and words of one syllable - obviously <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
You're a good egg ! - and should be 'coddled' (hee hee)<br>
<br>
Ta ever so, Grani<br>
<br>
Note to everyone: thanks for all post perusals and help: the forum is a birds-nest full of 'good-eggs' <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Just reading you're previous post Roky and hasten to add ( my reply above) that I'd like to keep the subject of"installation" for a separate discussion - if that's OK? First, I'd be VERY happy if I could first succeed in creating the Bootable disk and getting it to run live on the Thinkpad: that would be a great step forward !<br>
<br>
The Thinkpad has a phone jack and 2X PCMCIA slots (plus floppy of course) and I have a PCMCIA Wi-Fi card for which I tried (without success) to get a driver for Windoze98.<br>
It's a LinkSys 2.4 adapter and it seems that"nobody knows" just what chipset might be contained in a particular card. It seems that they put in either a 'Broadcom' or (is it) 'Real something' chip set at will and there's no way of knowing which card has which chipset.<br>
<br>
So that's for later. Clearly, I first need to get the thing running live and from there, perhaps the wi-fi can be sorted and finally Antix installed? As of now, it has no internet connectivity - since I ditched my (expensive) phone ISP.<br>
<br>
Waddya think? <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

He makes sure to double check that it <strong>is the linux iso</strong> that he is going to load onto the usb with unetbootin.<br>

For the IBM Laptop. (which I figured would not boot from usb) I am hoping you have a floppy drive also since you did not mention it. You can bypass the IBM usb bios boot limitation by making a PLOP Boot floppy Disk in Windows. Download the Plop file in XP on Gateway (bet it does not have a floppy drive) and transfer Plop download via usb stick to IBM Laptop. I just Edited this part of post because the video does not show how to make a bootable plop floppy. Instead they add it to Windows Boot ini. So<br>
<br>
Download also on the Gateway and transfer via usb to IBM.<br>
<br>
Windows: Write the disk image with the program 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://www.chrysocome.net/rawwrite"<br>linktext was:"http://www.chrysocome.net/rawwrite"<br>====================================<br>
 to the floppy disk. If you could download the rawwrite 0.7 Binary .zip Windows rawwritewin-0.7.zip and unzip it in Window 98. If not possible to unzip in Windows 98. Unzip it in the Gateway then before transfer with usb.<br>
<br>
<br>
When you get that far and you can boot to a grub screen on the Gateway with the AntiX unetbootin made pendrive first. And can run live on the Gateway. So you know the pendrive is working OK. Then we will move on to Using PLOP Floppy and the same Pendrive to boot that pendrive on the iBM.<br>
<br>
I am posting from a IBM A22m that has no USB boot option in bios. I installed AntiX 11 via a pendrive and my PLOP floppy I made ages ago. So I know this method works on iBM with no usb boot option in bios.<br>
<br>
Don't forget about the rootdelay=20 I mentioned earlier also.<br>
<br>
Too bad you don't live across the street or down the block from me. Would be much simpler. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">Hi Roky, sorry I'm a bit late with the progress report - or lack thereof <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
Long story short!<br>
1. I've got a Kingston 4gb stick (fairly new) for which Kingston don't supply a win98 driver - so only good for the Gateway: hence I haven't bothered trying to use this.<br>
2. The stick I'm trying to use is a SanDisk U3 Cruzer Micro 2gb: this was problematic from the day it was bought - maybe 5 years ago - on sale at Bestbuy??? - go figure - suckered <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span>(. You'll know that the"U3" is a load of s.h.1.t ! Apparently, the stick is partitioned into 2 sections, one being read as some kind of"CD" and holds the U3"Launchpad" and is read-only and"cannot be removed" - or so it seemed. The other partition seems useable as a plain stick. Some while ago, I thought I had succeeded in totally removing the U3 effect, as the stick seemed to be behaving normally in the Thinkpad - and the Gateway - but apparently not.<br>
3. I took the stick and followed your instructions - no go: Gateway booted into windoze, um???<br>
4. Did research and found a Launchpad remover - apparently - ref. 
<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://u3.sandisk.com/launchpadremoval.htm"<br>linktext was:"http://u3.sandisk.com/launchpadremoval.htm"<br>====================================<br>
.<br>
5. After running that, it gave the message,"The Cruzer now operates as a"Normal" pendrive" - or words to that effect.<br>
6. Thought I'd better Format (quick format seems the only option) again in windozeXP - did so, then again loaded the antix iso using Unetbootin: checked the Bios boot order and rebooted with stick in hole.<br>
7. After comp switched-on, up came my HDD password request, (oh, oh !): gave it and it promptly booted windoze.<br>
8. what the hell am I doing wrong? (all the mad, frustrated smilies - and then some ;-(<br>

PS: the antix-M11 iso <em>does</em> contain within itself the ability to boot - doesn't it ?</div>

<span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> If it didn't. I wold not have it installed on all my gear. I know the trouble some carbon unit interface can be a pain sometimes, to get things working. I have a few Sandisk Cruzers and the very <strong>first</strong> thing I did was<br>

Sandisk thought was a benefit for me. I needed a Windows computer to un-install this.

Driver for Windows 98 for Kingston Flash drive. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
Don't know why you would need that to make a bootable flash drive out of it.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #FF0000">Edit</span><br>
<br>
You would probably save your self some grief by buying a 5 pack or 10 pack of CDR disks (good quality)<br>
Beg, borrow or steal a cdrw drive if the gateway does not have that abiity to burn cds. Do <strong>not buy</strong> CDRW disks as your Windows 98 Laptop won't boot it probably. My IBM A22m boots cdr ok. It is Dead in the water when it comes to booting a Linux Iso on a cdrw disk.<br>
<br>
Use something like

Then just use that disk to run live and test instead of USB as you are having so much trouble doing this. Just a suggestion though. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>
