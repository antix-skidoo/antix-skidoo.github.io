<div class="content">We may have got our wires crossed. What you see in the screenshot is what I've had since I booted the live CD in safe mode. Since then, it's always looked this good but I can't log out or drop into a terminal without getting an"input not supported" message and the whole system freezes. I assume this is due to whatever happened that made"safe mode" permanent. Or at least the graphics driver.<br>
<br>
I only have 256MB RAM and the swap is more than twice that. My main box runs LinuxMint and with everything I'd ever want installed, I'm only using 4.4 GB in /. And in the antiX box, I haven't removed any of the unnecessary files and programs yet. Also, conky isn't showing that I have a separate /home partition of 30 or so GiB. Sorry. If I'd know why you wanted the screenshot, I could have told you.</div>

<div class="content">Md5sum is OK? I am assuming so. If you posted it OK earlier. I have a lot on my plate and will have forgot that.<br>

I wanted the screenshot because <br>

and from what I needed to see. Everything looked normal for the theme in fluxbox used.<br>
Your freeze may be other hardware related maybe, because of computer age or external hardware plugged in.<br>

I wish SamK or other member with older gear chimes in here. Because in todays cyberspace requirements. That is not much. Just my opinion. I used to run

. <strong>Swap was always set at 2 gig in case OF FREEZING&gt;hint,hint.</strong><br>
<br>
And I did this on older versions of AntiX which were not as demanding on specs as 15 now is. My IBM a22M and 390E was Pentium 2 and 256MB of ram and never froze set up like I describe. My links proves it and I was able to sell both also on the local hotline later on (radio sales advertising).<br>
<br>
Freezing can come from a lot of reasons though. But from what i HAVE READ. You freeze could be not enough ram with too little swap.<br>

I'll wait for BitJam or some other member to comment on that. I see nothing wrong using vesa myself. Or any errors in your xorg.conf.<br>
I know BitJam is busy constructing MX-15. So it might be a long wait.</div>

Some older kernels are in synaptic package manager on my box. Maybe try out one of those like 3.16 or lower.</div>

<div class="content">I've had a lot of issues with Linux over the years, but never with graphics or swap.<br>
<br>
I just used the rule of thumb, swap should be twice RAM. And, when the screen was unreadable, I could drop into a terminal without problems.<br>
<br>
What I don't understand is why booting from live CD in Safe graphics mode somehow got made permanent when I installed. But I'm pretty sure the problem is related to that.<br>
<br>
I'm going to try reinstalling with larger swap and will let you know. I'm also going to play around with Grub2, since I've found some posts about that"input not suported" message that recommend changes to Grub2.<br>
<br>
I'll keep you posted. Thanks for all the effort.</div>

<div class="content">My previous post with all the antix links on google search explain that via the correspondence in the alpha and beta threads between BitJam and I unsnarling the kernel and xorg dropped support for the savage graphics chip.<br>
<br>
If you concentrate on recent changes with savage graphics and the disinterest in supporting those chips anymore by searching on the net.<br>
You may understand where I am coming from.<br>
<br>
Vesa was put there after install to get you to a desktop. If you feel like experimenting. Here ya go<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Savage"<br>linktext was:"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Savage"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Make sure the savage graphics driver is still installed though before making changes. Make a backup or original xor.conf in case you end up with nothing working again.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #FF4000">Edit:</span><br>
<br>
Hmmmm. This came out in May.<br>
<br>

<br>========= SCRAPER REMOVED AN EMBEDDED LINK HERE ===========<br>url was:"http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2015-May/002603.html"<br>linktext was:"http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announ ... 02603.html"<br>====================================<br>
<br>
<br>
check you savage graphics driver version against that. In case you don't know. What I have read on this. The Savage driver support in Linux is written by one guy who does this a hobby. Not a production thing at all. Same for via and openchrome. Same for Sis. <br>
<br>
Everybody is supporting Ati, Nvidia, Intel graphics chips and what ever comes on embedded boards like raspberry pi boards.<br>
You may never have experienced trouble before. But the world is leaving guys like us behind. Slowly but surely.<br>
No interest in gear that most folks think should be in the landfill.</div>

<div class="content">OMG, it's working!<br>
<br>
I used the xorg 99-savage.conf file from the Arch Linux site, and it's working! I can drop into a terminal and log out with no issues!<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for all your time and hard work and patience on this, rokytnji. I'd just about given up hope.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Oh, crap! I now see I deleted the wrong post &amp; substituted this instead. My brain has seized up.</div>

<div class="content">The arch wiki was just for the xorg.conf file in case you wanted to try it out. The tar link was just to show what the most current version the savage driver is.<br>
I am not suggesting you install anything. <br>

<br>
<br>
My savage chip and antix 15 install on my T23 does not freeze up like yours. So rolling with vesa is good enough for me.<br>
I can live with stuttering video on it.<br>
<br>
But, maybe later on. When time permits. I'll check back in this thread and look over my posts and see what I can break.<br>
I break things regular like to see if I can fix them.</div>

<div class="content">rokytnji, I buggered up on posting my"it's working" post. Then I realized if I edited the post, you probably wouldn't get a notice about a new post. So here's another thank-you, and if you scroll up a couple of posts, you'll see how I (you, really) fixed my problem.</div>
