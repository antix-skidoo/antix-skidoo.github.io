<div class="content">I've run into a little pbm due to my own ignorance in the way I installed Antix. I installed it using the"testing" repos, then ran into some issues and changed my repositories to just use"stable", which resolved a lot of things (since"testing" did not seem as stable as I expected and as it seemed to be years ago when I used SimplyMepis). Only pbm is now that occasionally I try to upgrade a package when updates are available in stable, but sometimes run into all kinds of dependency hell since some libraries are apparently &gt; the versions required by the package being upgraded and I have to go back and find the complaining libraries and force them back to the"stable" version. Is there a straight-forward way in apt-get or synaptic to correct my Antix v13.2 installation back to"stable" w/o having to reinstall?</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>wildstar84 wrote:</cite>Is there a straight-forward way in apt-get or synaptic to correct my Antix v13.2 installation back to"stable" w/o having to reinstall?</div></blockquote>The short answer is there no simple or reliable way to do what you want.<br>
<br>
It is possible to try and do it by handling each step manually, but there is no guarantee of success. Even if it initially appears to have worked, there will always be some doubt about how thoroughly it worked. You might never be certain about how much confidence you can place in the downgraded system working in the same manner as one that was created using the Stable repo from the outset.<br>
<blockquote><div><cite>Abstract from Debian reference manual wrote:</cite><strong>Caution</strong><br>
<br>
Downgrading is not officially supported by the Debian by design. It should be done only as a part of emergency recovery process. Despite of this situation, it is known to work well in many incidents. For critical systems, you should backup all important data on the system after the recovery operation and re-install the new system from the scratch.</div></blockquote>

Probably the quickest and most reliable method is to backup your data files and re-install using only the Stable repos. There will be a few mainly security updates to add once the installation is complete (many fewer than installaing Testing then updating/upgrading). In fact there are more than usually expected due to a recently discovered and fixed security flaw that affected just about every Linux system in the world (not just antiX).</div>

<div class="content">Well, it seems that stable has caught up to me or something as - as of now, I have successfully got all packages that would not update before, namely samba and it's dependencies have now been updated and everything is now at the latest stable version, I'm a happy camper!</div>
