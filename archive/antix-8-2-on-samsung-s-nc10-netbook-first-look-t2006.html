<div class="content">I bought a Samsung NC10 two days ago.<br>
There was a cut in price due to the delivery of a new netbook n140, a light change in the look but the same specs.<br>
<br>
I feel more comfortable with a 10" screen than with my eeepc 701 (7"), and with a nearly full size keyboard.<br>
Booting 8.2 full from the live-USB, I got the same problem I had with the eeepc: the boot process hanged somewhere starting X and/or slim.<br>
I had to use the same workaround: boot the live-USB in single mode, login root at the terminal prompt after de-activating the numlock (by chance the key Alt+F11=Numlock works), then start slim.<br>
<br>
Mepis installer worked fine. Installed antiX on a 30 GB ext3 partition.<br>
Wifi with wicd works out of the box.<br>
I am listening music on streamtuner, I had to push up the controls in alsamixer, sound maybe a little low.<br>
<br>
Most of the function keys do not work, or have erroneous bindings. I miss the brightness up and down keys. Hotkeys worked better on the eeepc. Googling around, it seems that the problem is common with Debian. Got to try to fix it.<br>
<br>
For now I feel happy with my purchase and I will stay with antiX (I tried one month ago easypeasy - aka eeebuntu, an Ubuntu derivative for netbooks) on the eepc, but it was far too heavy (booted in 2mn on the lowspec Celeron at 600 MHz, vs. 50 s for antiX)</div>

<div class="content">I felt the same way when I tried all the eee Ubuntu distros like Easy Peasy and EEEbuntu base even. It made the EEE 900 of mine maneuver like a barge wagon. So when I figured I was already running AntiX on all my Other older laptops. I figured why not see what AntiX will do on my netbook. It was worth the configuring in my estimation because it boots and flys as quick or quicker as the Stock Xandros. And is just as full featured or more so as a Ubuntu derevitive. Have you ever tried to get streamtuner going with xmms2 in Ubuntu? It was a exercise in futility for me. I had to look at trying to tie in Exaile Music player to get the right plugins. Finally said screw this .<br>
<br>
I still am looking foward to seeing how your AntiX install goes on your 701. I know you are busy and going to enjoy your NC10 and ease your way with the 701 now. When you finally get the time to shoe horn your AntiX intall on the 701. I hope you let me link it to the EEE Forums WIKI and you link it to the Mepis and AntiX WIKIS also.<br>
Because (Just my opinion) AntiX is like a Puppy Linux on Steroids on a EEE PC.</div>
