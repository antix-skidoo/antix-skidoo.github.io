<div class="content">I see a golden opportunity for antiX Linux and other lightweight distros. I see many factors that should be steering people towards antiX:<br>
1. End of Windows XP support in 2014: In order to continue using these computers (without glaringly inferior security), people need to"upgrade" to a newer Windows OS or upgrade to Linux."Upgrading" to Windows 7 or 8 will mean downgrading the computer's speed and stability. (I'm assuming that Windows 8 will be at least as heavy as 7. I just find it hard to believe that Microsoft will release a SECOND OS that's lighter than its predecessor.) By 2014, even Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc. will likely be heavier than Windows XP. I just find it hard to believe that these distros will become lighter given that it's never happened in the past.<br>
2. Controversy over Ubuntu's switch to Unity: From what I've read, Unity is supposed to work better than GNOME on tablets, smartphones, etc. However, many people don't like how it works on desktops. I just can't imagine how the desktop goes away. I just can't imagine doing any serious work (like word processing, spreadsheets, reports, etc.) on a tablet or smartphone. It seems to me that you'd use a tablet or smartphone just to check up on messages and send out some concise responses. antiX Linux implements IceWM extremely well, and I can see it appealing to former Ubuntu users.<br>
3. Controversy over the new GNOME and KDE: I'm hearing people say that GNOME 2 was so much better than GNOME 3, and KDE 3 was so much better than KDE4. Again, antiX Linux implements IceWM extremely well.<br>
4. Limited competition: While the upper end of the Linux market is saturated, the lower end is not. Of the top ten distros on Distrowatch, only Puppy Linux is lightweight AND user-friendly. Seven are heavyweight and user-friendly, and the other two are Debian and Arch Linux. Lubuntu is #15, CrunchBang is #21, Vector is #25, and Tiny Core is #29.</div>

<div class="content">I definitely, agree with you on most of this. Linux is the future of PC market - MS Windows is loosing their grasp on it, worldwide. And the"middle-weight" desktops are the way to go for older computers.<br>
<br>
LinuxMint is developing several middle-weight desktop/window manager editions for there OS-distro. Besides, a newer and lighter Xfce desktop, there is a Mint Fluxbox, LXDE and soon a Mint-Openbox version. Over the next few months or more - all these versions of LinuxMint are making the conversion from Ubuntu and are going with a Debian-testing-base for their disto.<br>
<br>
LinuxMint has been in the Top 3 on DistroWatch for sometime, now.<br>
<br>
But, yes ... this is an excellent opportunity for antiX to move up in the rankings.</div>
