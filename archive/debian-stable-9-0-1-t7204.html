<div class="content">Yesterday, I installed Debian stable (don't ask), it was fine for a day, on the second day, I ran into problems with the repos (security) couldn't download nothing. <br>
No ALSA, just Pulseaudio, what a nightmare!<br>
<br>
Got outta Dodge, wiped the partition and back to antiX. My next project is MX for my wife.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Please devs, DO NOT REPLACE alsa with pulseaudio! pretty please with sugar on top! Anything Pottering/Fedora touches turns to caca.</div>

<div class="content">I understand completely. Just for my own learning. I think back when I ran AntiX 11 for the longest time on my motorcycle shop computer. I dist-upgraded with the next debian release repos . I think it was Jessie at that time. I was locked out of /usr/local/bin section after that. <br>
Since systemd defaults to /usr/bin. <br>
<br>
Long story short. Shutdown broke. I tried poking around to edit systemd. Looked at the code blob and did a WTF. Where is the text file?<br>
I can't use geany or leafpad or nano on this? So backed up needed stuff and moved on To AntiX 15. Which was current then.<br>
<br>
I have a minor feud with a one debian user on LinuxQuestions when it comes to answering threads on low spec machines. He follows my posts around with his Debian this and that. I ignore this feud as life is short and I don't take operating systems seriously. Even Windows.<br>
<br>
I use what works for me. Like tools in a tool box. Everyone has a right to their own tools. Like some members I know here who do the BSD dance. I failed gloriously playing with BSD myself. The running joke at LQ." Oh my god the world is ending. Rok installed BSD". <br>

<div class="content">Thanks, roky...<br>
As one gets older, things start to change, no silly arguments, no stupid contest of who knows more, eye-candy or latest DE mean nothing to me, they say the second thing that goes is your mind, (don't ask what's the first). It's a generational thing, my grandchildren and I don't talk to each other, nothing to talk about, my cell phone is a $20 Blu, they use iphones, they use Mac, I use Linux/Unix, I turned 70 last month, nothing in common, so I keep my mouth shut and try to KISS everything. So ignore these fools who 10 years ago never heard of Linux.</div>
