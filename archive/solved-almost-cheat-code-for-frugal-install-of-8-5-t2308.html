<div class="content">I made use of an iso boot code I found in the FAQ so now it works again. Thanks <br>
<br>
But I have to learn how to go from Demo to Root for to be able to listen to my music on the NTFS. But that is another thread. <br>
<br>
My old text<br>
<br>
I use"frugal install" a lot in puppy linux because it is rather fast way to test a distro. <br>
<br>
So to my joy I read that anticapitalista actually are using that on the latest version of AntiX8.5 Final he develops. <br>
<br>
Is that possible to use on the prefinal too for frugal isntall of an internal hdd? As of now I have it on an usb but my old Compaq Presario refuse to boot from usb. <br>
<br>
and when reading this. <br>
<br>

<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I have just been running antiX as a frugal install (in Puppy language) on a partition on my harddrive with rootfs persistence set. It works very well. It is very much like how Puppy runs and all savings are carried over to next boot. No real need to install.</div></blockquote>
I very much would like to do the same but I am not clever enough to figure out what to write in the menu.lst of grub4DOS or grub2 in case that is needed? <br>
<br>
So hope that Anticapitalista read this and want to share the cheat code needed to get it to work. <br>
<br>
Looking forward with great expectations to the final version of 8.5 but would be cool to test frugal install even now if that is possible with the prefinal iso.</div>

<div class="content">Basically a frugal install is a fromiso boot plus the cheatcodes for the persistent / (root) and /home. You would need a partition for the iso (plus vmlinuz and initrd.gz) and another for the persistency (can be mingled with other data, I think, but not with any other system so not to mix things).<br>
Supposing antix-M8.5-prefinal.iso, its vmlinuz and its initrd.gz (these extracted with MC or Isomaster etc.) is in antiX directory in sda1 and sda2 is set for the persistency, then:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>title antiX-M8.5-prefinal frugal
kernel (hd0,0)/antiX/vmlinuz fromhd=/dev/sda1 fromiso=/antiX/antiX-M8.5-prefinal.iso rootfs=/dev/sda2 homefs=/dev/sda2 lang=xx vga=791
initrd (hd0,0)/antiX/initrd.gz
boot
</code></pre></div>
lang=xx being your desired system language (like lang=br for Brazilian Portuguese). You can set xres=1024x768 or any other resolution too (but if you don't, as with the language you may set it at GRUB's menu screen - F2 and F3).<br>

<div class="content">Thanks indeed. I do my best to replicate the set up you suggested. <br>
In case I fail I maybe write about it here within a week or so. <br>
<br>
I did test it using the 8.5 prefinal versions that is available already now and I write from within AntiX now. <br>
<br>
Now I have to find the set keyboard set up to my local Swedish version. To set lang=se did not work. <br>
<br>
Maybe it is SV or sv I can test it next boot. <br>
<br>
Kind of cool that it just worked. <br>
<br>
I am a pessimist. I guess when I shut down and reboot it will search for the sda2 and find it to be a recovery partition that windows have tried to hide or a swap partition maybe? Hope it doesnt mess up with the recovery thing. If it does it is my fault and not anybody else fault. <br>
<br>
Once again. <br>
<br>
Very much appreciated that you took time and described it on a level that allowed me to actually get it going.</div>

<div class="content">You're right that the code is sv.<br>
You can set-up your partitions with Gparted (Menu&gt;Applications&gt;System(or Tools etc.)&gt;Gparted).<br>
You can have up to 4 (four) primary partitions in a hard-drive, so if you plan to create some partitions in the future, create a so called extended partition. Inside this extended partition you may create several other partitions (I don't know how much). The example I gave you was just an example. I believe it could mess with windows recovery if you used its partition and if you pointed it to the swap partition the persistency wouldn't work.</div>

<div class="content">lang=se should work, but be aware that there is no translation for the antiX fluxbox/icewm menu.<br>
If you open a terminal and su to root, does the terminal show in Swedesh? Same with keyboard, it should type Swedish characters.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to both of you. I looked into it using puppy. Sda2 is the recovery partition antiX wre very much to it. a lot of directories and wallpaters and other directories like home and demo and usr and var and so on. <br>
<br>
I am in Antix now frugal install and I have edited in puppy the menu.lst to not write more to the recovery. <br>
<br>
I failed to do a proper reboot but a shutdown has worked twice now. So I test more tomorrow. <br>
I test frugal install tomorrow on the old compaw too. and that one I can have a proper sda2<br>
<br>
Re the chars on keyboard. well now I have changed th lang=se to lang=us instead. <br>
but in terminal I write setxkbmap se and that way I get a proper kbmap. <br>
<br>
anticapitalista thanks indeed for setting up A so it can do frugal instal at all with saving. <br>
<br>
Is it very difficult to change so it can save in same partition that it boots from?<br>
Could one not have a Casper/rw file from pendrivelinux? They are premade so easy to use even for beginners? What cheat code does it need to be able to save in a casper-rw file?<br>
<br>
I maybe boot once or twice again to check if it survives many reboots. Nut I most likely read and answer here only tomorrow. Feel very sleepy now past midnight. <br>
<br>
To both of you. Thanks again for caring about frugal install. Most linux fans see that as a cheat or something one just dont do. Only real install is the way to use linux they tells me.</div>

<div class="content">The antiX frugal install works very well and is really simple (you can set it up on a flash drive using <strong>Control Center &gt; Discs &gt; antiX2usb</strong>).<br>
<br>
For your current set-up, you could maybe try to change rootfs= and homefs= to /dev/sda1 in the menu.lst and see if it works fine (I don't know) but it must have some space for all the savings.<br>
<br>
Regarding your system locale, you could try the following to make it permanent (from antix.mepis.org):
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>i) As root in a terminal dpkg-reconfigure locales (choose all/default unless you need extras and then the locale of your dektop eg es_ES.UTF-8 for Spanish) <br>
<br>
ii) Add this line below the export line in /etc/profile export LANG=es_ES.UTF-8 (obviously use the one you chose in i) above)

<div class="content">The older computer has only linux on it. It is old compaq pressario 8143 in the 8000 series maybe from 2003 or so. <br>
<br>
Debian/Elive in full install and pupp431std in frugal install. <br>
<br>
Debian/Elive installed some kind of partition first ? or maybe it was there from start from Linux Mint a"locked" partition for Mint? <br>
<br>
So elive and mint are on sda2 and thus I tried to change the root (hd0,1) instead of 0,0 <br>
<br>
but it fail still boot correctly. The surprising thing is that it fail to boot the USB with unetbootin install of antiX-8.5-prefinal on it too. While that one boot just fine on the windows machine with sda1 as the primary. <br>
<br>
I don't mind to erase or delete the elive install there but I guess the only way is to use a DVD then. I have tried to change the boot code to refer to sda2 instead. <br>
<br>
Here is now it looks now in my modern compaq <br>
<br>
title antiX-M8.5-prefinal frugal suggested on the antiX forum 03/28/2010<br>
kernel (hd0,0)/antiX/vmlinuz fromhd=/dev/sda1 fromiso=/antiX/antiX-M8.5-prefinal.iso lang=us vga=788<br>
initrd (hd0,0)/antiX/initrd.gz<br>
boot<br>
<br>
Now I log out of the modern computer and give the menu.lst for the older compaq.<br>
<br>
title antiX-M8.5-prefinal frugal<br>
root (hd0,1)<br>
kernel /antiX/vmlinuz fromhd=/dev/sda2 fromiso=/antiX/antiX-M8.5-prefinal.iso lang=us vga=788<br>
initrd /antiX/initrd.gz<br>
boot<br>
<br>
I have also tested with <br>
kernel (hd0,1)/antiX/vmlinuz fromhd=/dev/sda2 fromiso=/antiX/antiX-M8.5-prefinal.iso lang=us vga=788<br>
initrd (hd0,1)/antiX/initrd.gz<br>
<br>
Both vmlinuz and initrd.gz seems to do their thing but they fail to find the antiX file system the error says. <br>
<br>
Dropping you to a very limited shell it says. <br>
<br>
Is it easy to update to the final from the prefinal. The best would be to boot from a DVD and let antiX install itself to the hdd so I can add puppy in frugal install later. <br>
<br>
But how do I tell antix to get rid of the locked partition that seems to create trouble? To be able to use older linuxes I guess Ext2 format is best? I failed to get puppy going on jfs that Elive preferred and even ext4 seems to not be working for me for puppy linux.</div>

<div class="content">A quick post.<br>
<br>
antiX fromiso/iso file must be on ext2 or ext3 partition otherwise it will give that error you get. Fat32 is supposed to work, but hasn't really been tested.<br>
<br>
To get the frugal part, you need a spare aprtition where you save the stuff to, that can be ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs (not sure about others), but you need the rootfs=/dev/xxxx to point to the partition.</div>

<div class="content">Mmm.<br>
<br>
I am impatient guy obviously. I did a full install from a DVD with 8.5prefinal on it. <br>
Maybe that is a too old one. you guys talk about rc3 that is patched and such. <br>
<br>
where is the prefinal one in relation to that? <br>
<br>
Anyway now when it is formatted in Ext3 by the automatic installer it works well.<br>
I installed puppy to get a dual boot with two linuxes on the hdd that is set as sda1 <br>
and antiX made a save partition I trust but on sda1 is shown in puppy. <br>
<br>
I have 500mb RAM and the cpu is a p4 running at 2.3GHz I guess. <br>
<br>
But the cpu fan is running like mad when I do streaming video. Is that normal. <br>
<br>
I wonder about the iceape suite. Sure it is practical with a suite that can do almost anything like news mail html browsing and so on. <br>
<br>
But Firefox 3.6 had an update now to get rid of a nasty exploit and how is iceape security? <br>
<br>
Anyway. Looking forward to update to the 8.5 final when it comes out. <br>
<br>
oops I need to learn how to set up the firewall too. But that most likely is talked about in FAQ or such so I look into that later. <br>
<br>
Thanks for all help. Much appreciated!</div>

<div class="content">Hi, newbody. The prefinal is the latest one.<br>
<br>
Flash videos use a lot of CPU (in my Athlon XP 1466MHz it goes right up to 90+%). Other formats like .wmv use much less CPU when streaming. Maybe the fan works hard because the P4 gets hot.<br>
<br>
Iceape is fairly current. I wouldn't worry about this exploit thing.<br>
<br>
To set up the firewall (FireHol) go to Control Center &gt; Network &gt; Configure Firewall (or something alike). Change NO for YES for it to start at boot time and also click on the 'Start Firewall' button to start it. Anyway it's recommended to read the FAQ, there are many answers for common questions there.</div>

<br>
Flash videos use a lot of CPU (in my Athlon XP 1466MHz it goes right up to 90+%). Other formats like .wmv use much less CPU when streaming. Maybe the fan works hard because the P4 gets hot.<br>
<br>
Iceape is fairly current. I wouldn't worry about this exploit thing.<br>
<br>
To set up the firewall (FireHol) go to Control Center &gt; Network &gt; Configure Firewall (or something alike). Change NO for YES for it to start at boot time and also click on the 'Start Firewall' button to start it. Anyway it's recommended to read the FAQ, there are many answers for common questions there.</div></blockquote>
thanks I will test this.<br>
<br>
I want to install antiX on my neighbors computer because he wants to read in his native Swedish and if I do lang=se then that would hopefully work for him. But he need a firewall to be safe. He is 80 years old and not so good at english. Not me either. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">root password is root. (Press F1 at boot grub menu screen on live for more information)<br>
<br>
To get swedish keyboard and apps that are supported in Swedish, at boot grub for livecd type <br>
lang=se<br>
<br>
This should carry over to install.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, both icewm and fluxbox menu will be in English, so you will need to edit them by hand if your neighbour needs help with the language.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for such fast answer. <br>
<br>
Another hurdle or problem I saw. Trying to save a screenshot to the HDD it say that one need permissio. <br>
<br>
Trying to get that it seems to go through a long indexing of the whole partition? Is that the only way to get permission? <br>
<br>
Is there no easy way? I doubt he will know how to do that my neighbor will do that on his own. Even I don't get it. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
sad about them having no swedish. AntiX seems the absolute best there is available. <br>
<br>
MHHP told us he got swedish at the mepis forum. I am not part of that one though. I linked to it today. <br>
<br>
I have to ask him what he did to get swedish then.</div>
