cli-installer hangs after"y" to"repartition?". Wasn't able to locate cli-installer; expected to find it in /sbin, /bin, /usr/sbin, or /usr/bin.<br>
<br>
Before I sent this, I noticed that cfdisk had finally loaded. Install went semi-smoothly. I ended up with a bootable drive. No browser. XTerm does not start. Few items on the right click menu. Some odd messages during the install and boot make me suspect a bad drive. I noticed that 20 gig drives can be bought for $14; if I don't find other drives around here, I will wait for a new one to arrive.<br>

Boot parameter dpi=110 and dpi=150 seemed to have no effect. Backgrounds on the right click menuing system are cute but interfere with what needs to be read.</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>mckemie wrote:</cite>cli-installer hangs after"y" to"repartition?". Wasn't able to locate cli-installer; expected to find it in /sbin, /bin, /usr/sbin, or /usr/bin.</div></blockquote>That's a reasonable expectation but almost all the antiX specific programs are in /usr/local/bin.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Before I sent this, I noticed that cfdisk had finally loaded. Install went semi-smoothly. I ended up with a bootable drive. </div></blockquote>Great news!<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>No browser. XTerm does not start. Few items on the right click menu. </div></blockquote>Some of this is because you are using a test iso. I was able to get the browser to start and also get a gui terminal. We use RoxTerm. This problem is my biggest concern ATM. I'm hoping they are just slow.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Some odd messages during the install and boot make me suspect a bad drive. I noticed that 20 gig drives can be bought for $14; if I don't find other drives around here, I will wait for a new one to arrive.</div></blockquote>Linux is more chatty than it used to be. You can probably find many/most of these messages in the output of the dmesg program. You can use something like"dmesg | tail -n 100" to just see the last 100 lines.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Boot parameter dpi=110 and dpi=150 seemed to have no effect.</div></blockquote>The way this works is that those boot parameters (and many others) work on the LiveCD. When you install from the LiveCD to your hard drive, all those settings get carried over but the boot parameters no longer work. I realize this is counter-intuitive. The reason for this strange setup is because"we" (the antiX team) have a lot of control over what happens when a LiveCD boots. But when you install, we have to make the system as Debian-like as possible which means we lose a lot of the control we once had. If we try to hang onto control by modifying startup files then our modifications can get lost in an upgrade causing mysterious failures.<br>
<br>
If you are still using the default"slim" display manager then you can adjust the dpi by editing (as root) /etc/slim.conf and adding"-dpi 120" to the"xserver_arguments" line. One way to edit slim.conf is to open a terminal and run the"sux" command. Give it the root password when asked then run"leafpad /etc/slim.conf &amp;". The"sux" program gives you root privileges and lets you open up windows as well on the desktop of a normal user.<br>
<br>
The other way is to go to"Control Centre" --&gt;"System""Edit Config files" and then pick the slim.conf tab.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Backgrounds on the right click menuing system are cute but interfere with what needs to be read.</div></blockquote>You can toggle this with"Fluxbox settings" --&gt;"Configuration""Transparency" --&gt;"Force pseudo-transparency".<br>

Normally, there are a variety of backgrounds to choose from. <br>

I am delighted and relieved that you were able to install. It sounds like you are raring to go. I can think of three options, none of them perfect:<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li> Sit and wait for the next release</li>
<li> Customize your current install and then make a custom cd for your other systems</li>
<li> Get a antiX-M11 cd modified to boot on your system and start from there.</li></ol>
I don't mind helping you get an antiX-M11 cd you can boot. My concern is that there are now 100's of Megs of updates that will need to be done (almost all of it is automatic). Logging and rebooting from X-windows will become broken until you fix the /etc/sudoers file. When the new release comes out I would suggest that you start over using that.<br>
<br>
If you want to start installing programs now, you can run"sux" in a terminal window and then run:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># apt-get update
# apt-get install synaptic
# synaptic &amp;</code></pre></div>The thing is that once the new release comes out I would highly recommend that you switch over and start using that.<br>
<br>
My biggest concern ATM is that you don't have a browser or a X-windows terminal (assuming RoxTerm is not working). You might find some clues in the log files in /var/log. I would try:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># cd /var/log
# tail -n 50 dmesg
# tail -n 50 messages
# tail -n 50 Xorg.0.log</code></pre></div></div>
