<div class="content">Greetings from wet Western Washington -<br>
<br>
Yet another testimonial regarding antiX 11 - I am the one guy in a group of friends that actually likes playing with computers, breaking them and upgrading them, but this Dell Dimension 4550 fought me every step of the way.<br>
<br>
XP was taking 10 minutes to load completely ( not a stretch as the machine has only 256 MB RAM ), so I extolled the owner on the virtues of antiX for such a system. After a tenative ' really? ' and an assurance from me that her precious Windows installation was safe, she agreed to let me play.<br>
<br>
First getting a working CD drive in it - check<br>
<br>
Another week and was able to install a second hard drive ( remember the promise of safety ... ) <br>
<br>
Trying to boot it from 3 different burnt CDs ( antiX11, antix 8.5, Mepis 8.5_32 ) over a period of a few weeks - no joy<br>
<br>
Booting it off of a usb stick - antiX 11 via antixusb burn - no joy, <br>
<br>
Booting it off of a usb stick - antiX 11 via unetbootin burn - success after I probably abandoned the first boot attempt too early ( patience grasshopper ).<br>
<br>
So, last night at 10pm I finally was able to install antix 11 to the second drive- rebooted it and got the dreaded grub error 21. I went in and played with the drive numbers in menu.lst - no joy ... and ... as it was getting late and I had no answers, had to explain that I would be back today after work and try again - until then, I left the usb stick with antiX 11 running for web access - she was not happy ( remember the promise of safety ).<br>
<br>
This afternoon after a scroogle search I ended up at a mepiscommunity forum post by Lucky9 ( I knew then that everything would be alright ) about bios not recognizing second hard drives.<br>
<br>
After work today I walked into her house with confidence, checked the bios, reset the second hard drive to auto and rebooted.<br>
<br>
<span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Its great to have my status as a computer god <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> back<br>
<br>
Thanks for a great distribution and for being members of a great community - the story that is infrequently commented on is the confidence that such an operating system and such support give to us who like to tinker - and the effect of those around that person as they begin to understand the difference between oss.</div>

<div class="content">I once had a winXP install on my laptop that took 10 mins to load... That's what really got me started using GNU/Linux systems (it was a used laptop that came without recovery disks). There is only one instance of windows left on my 3 running computers that I keep for light gaming and just in case something has to be done online using windows... I really hate that! In all I have about 7 different distros running across the 3 pcs. And I am about to try to resurrect another old desktop and two really old laptops that a friend got and has no use for, all using AntiX! It's really great stuff and I would (and do!) recommend it to anyone who wants something fairly user-friendly but encourages getting"under the hood" and messing with things. We're glad you like it!</div>
