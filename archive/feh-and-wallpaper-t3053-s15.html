<div class="content">Great work Dave.<br>
<br>
About dependencies. I think it is best to look at this as if we are going to install antiX apps from the antiX-core iso (plus xorg). That means we would need to list all the dependencies eg for the wallpaper app we need python2.6 and python-xdg (and maybe others). Also, if we want to make it available to other Debian/Debian-based distros such as MEPIS, then we would also need to add feh as a dependency (and maybe others).<br>
<br>
I'll check again, but I think the xinitrc template may need changing a bit to cater for live use.<br>
The .wallpaper files don't get 'installed' IIRC. Remember if user is using core, then the .wallpaper folder needs to be created.<br>
Maybe the pre-install script should check/ask if user has fluxbox/icewm/openbox etc installed and which is default for xinitrc and .wallpaper/session file.</div>

<div class="content">Day 2. I think I should have said no I think when installing your deb Dave <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> . I said yes to all instead and borked my Desktop. On fluxbox logout to slim. No login (failed to execute login) Probably because .xinitrc was empty. Good thing I have a Backups folder for that. <br>
<br>
Next was wbar and lxpanel were gone and fluxbox slit was acting funny (for lack of a better word/term. Don't ask as I had more serious problems than this ahead)<br>
<br>
So I uninstalled wbar, wbar config, and lxpanel next. Next I noticed in terminal when typing<br>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sux</code></pre></div>
I got s4x. Friggin numlock (IBM T23 has no numlock key) is enabled. Took me a while to even figure that one out because of my borked keyboard.<br>
<br>
Fixed it by booting live cd and making a text file with <br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>apt-get remove --purge numlockx<br>
sux</div></blockquote>
So I could copy and paste (along with my password) into terminal and try to get things sorted so I could at least regain control. I deleted /usr/local/bin/wallpaper.py plus the random.py (can't remember exact name at present) for now in /usr/local/bin.<br>
<br>
It's been scary. Was thinking reinstall. But. I would rather wait first for Antis new AntiX11 he has mentioned first to come out before blowing away completely this 8.5 install. Just feedback Dave. Not Bitchin. Glad I got things somewhat sorted (not perfect but usable now). Just running straight fluxbox with tint2 panel for now (so I can show what is open, Fluxbox slit not doing this for now. Remember acting funny)<br>
<br>
I am monitoring wireless, battery and everything else in conky for now with nothing showing as far as volume icon, battery, wireless (wicd) in taskbar. Conky is handling all of that. <br>
<br>
My test flight crashed and burned. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span><br>
<br>
Edit: I left out a lot of other steps I took to fix things like Logout. I had to uninstall slim completely. Then reinstall slim again. Cant change slim backaground via antixcc anymore. Changes Won't stick, I can live with Debian spacefun slim theme though. <br>
Icewm I uninstalled completely. Edited .xinitrc to start only fluxbox also (after restoring backup I made). Nitrogen in 8.5 I uninstalled because changes would not stick on reboot or logout. I edited antixcc.sh and changed nitrogen entry to feh for now. Crude I know. But I am a crude linux user.</div>

<div class="content">From roky's post, it seems safer not to replace the startup files with the templates, but maybe to add the necessary lines for the wallpaper app to work to the startup files ie <br>
# Set wallpaper<br>
login_background.sh &amp; <br>
<br>
For icewm, this is easier as that line can go at the end of the startup file, but more complicated for fluxbox startup as it must come before the exec fluxbox line.<br>
<br>
May need to do something similar to the .xinitrc file.</div>

<div class="content">from a usability standpoint, the interface is a little confusing. You have to say how you are going to apply the image before selecting the image. if you choose open first, files are not selectable. since the preview is the same for whatever image type you select, the only way to see how image works on screen is to select the image and say ok. Now the good thing is your dialog stays open after saying OK! Very good! but if you want to see how the image might look with a different display type (say, fill or scale vs. center), then you have to select the fill type and the image all over again. <br>
<br>
I think you are getting very close on the interface, and I appreciate whatever programing challenges you are facing. But from a logical standpoint, a user needs to select the image first then the fill type.<br>
<br>
I did not try your deb out on my production system. I used a Virtual box setup so I cannot comment on roky's issues with the startup files. Mine works fine, but I've left mine antix m11 default on the test system.</div>

<div class="content">I am not sure why roky's system got all borked. By answering yes to all the questions for the deb install it simply moves a template file that I copied and edited from a fresh install. I can see the slim login execution failed as looking at it I had missed slim.conf. The other concerns I have no idea why that would have happened to be truthful. <br>
<br>
Anti,
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Maybe the pre-install script should check/ask if user has fluxbox/icewm/openbox etc installed and which is default for xinitrc and .wallpaper/session file.</div></blockquote> <br>
Just for confirmation, By this line are you suggesting that the postinst script builds a .xinitrc file for the user? <br>
Also for post #1, the .wallpaper files should be installed to /usr/share/antix-wallpaper/SKEL and on the first run of wallpaper.py copied over to ~/<br>
For post #2, It will be simple to add the lines to startup files separately as I have made the script already for add-start, adding the lineS to .xinitrc though will be difficult, maybe a series of install questions to build it would be better.<br>
<br>
D.O. will look into toggling the setting modes, that should be fixed I agree. When starting wallpaper.py, the open button will default to selecting a default folder. Maybe it would be better if it reads the previous setting mode and defaults to that? This way the open button will work as if you had already selected</div>

Maybe because my 8.5 install Dave is pretty long in the tooth Dave on this Laptop instead of a fresh install is all I can figure. The numlock snag is what really threw me because my keyboard was unusable so I kinda panicked. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>
<br>
The login_helper_.py (I can't remember the exact name) that replaced I think .xinitrc and startup threw me also as I tried and tried to figure a way to get wallpapers to set also on logout. I ended up with slim Debian Spacefun on Desktop as wallpaper on each logout and reboot. It was driving me crazy also. So I used Arch linux wiki for setting wallpaper with fehbg -1 and editing /.fluxbox.init and /.fluxbox/startup also.<br>
<br>
I Have your add startup and add key installed previously in my menu on this laptop plus a lot of other testing stuff on here that has been submitted over time in this forum. Poor baby/soul just could not stand the strain I guess.<br>

<div class="content">Roky rereading your post again I think I can see how it messed up your desktop, I know you seem not to be concerned as I am but I am trying to figure it out so I can configure the install scripts to avoid this. <br>
<br>
It looks to me like you have installed the .deb, which changed the startup files when you answered yes to the questions (as it should have). This would mean that lxpanel, wbar, ect... would not start on startup as they are simply not in the default startup templates that I have edited from a fresh install. I fixed this using anti's suggestion and just coping the code I have already made for add-start. Now it simply adds login_background.sh to startup, I will need to consider a bit more on how to comment out the other methods of setting wallpaper. So from your experience I believe I have solved that issue. These probably would have came back by starting them manually.<br>
<br>
The second major problem, with slim and numlock. I am thinking that there was an issue with .xinitrc installed by my deb and your slim.conf (the options configured where not the same), this would enter out the login execution failed bit with slim. Then the numlock would seem was an issue after you had reinstalled slim to resolve the login execution failed, as this would set the numlock option to"on" in slim.conf (as it is default). Other than that I cannot think of what would have changed that option, maybe something will come to me similar to this. <br>
<br>
Would this seem to fit with what you experienced? I would hate to make a bother by staying on the topic of your issue. It is just that I made a choice to copy a template as it was the simpler way but maybe not the best, I now would like to understand the issue so I can resolve it.</div>

<div class="content">Since my skill set is poke and hope. Plus my panic kicking in the next day when everything went fubar. Plus your greater knowledge than mine with these things.<br>
<br>
Yeah.<br>
1. Slim reinstall first . Then all wbar and lxpanel unnstall.<br>
2. wallpaper.py plus other py and sh deletions were next.<br>
3. numlock removal with apt-get next<br>
4. fehbg editing for setting wallpaper in /. fluxbox /init and /.fluxbox/startup and deleting login_helper.py last.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps. Your comment abut slim sounds right for numlock problem. When I checked your installed /.xinitrc and saw it was blank. I figured It was my fault on installing .deb where I must have stutter stepped some how during .deb install. Figured everything was all my fault as you and OU812 were using it just fine. Figured maybe my 8.5 install might be to blame also (so I could shift blame from me <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> )<br>

I think I will make it rebuild the .xinitrc, that will leave less of a likelihood of a blank .xinitrc. Hope I did not scare you off from trying again, as much as it may not seem to be a help it is. <br>

I have a new postinst script for building the startup files, the adding new lines to ~/*/startup were a simple copy from add-start. The more complicated one is .xinitrc, I have a working test script. This takes an original copy of the .xinitrc, removes the entries associated to the wallpaper app, re adds the entries with the modifications, asks which is the default window manager and sets it, finishes up. Now from this working copy I should be able to copy the code from the test script to the actual postinst script. However when I do this the postinst script will fail drastically. Now if I unpack the .deb and manually run postinst script it all works as it should. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> I am not sure what the reasoning is behind this, I am hoping that maybe you would have a suggestion. At the moment, I am thinking of going back to a template, but include a slim.conf template as well. This would ensure a matched and working set of configuration files. It would be less convenient but the install script is getting to the point where it is almost more complicated than the app it is installing. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> Also it occurs to me that ~/.xinitrc will not be change very much by the user, so what changes that are lost should be easy enough to reset, especially when the postinst script will make a backup named .xinitrc-bk. <br>
<br>
Here is my test script if you would like to take a look.<br>

I have fixed the bug you have mentioned, where you have to reselect the image each and every time. Now it stays selected, unless you close the wallpaper app. Also, the open button selecting the default folder has been changed to selecting the image, and all available options (Default Folder, Open Image, Default Color) have been entered in the menu.</div>
