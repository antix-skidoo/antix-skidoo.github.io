<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>By now, we all know that the NSA is spying on us. They read our emails, our texts, our Facebook posts, passwords, and they even listen to our phone calls. They record every thought we utter and every website we visit onto massive databases, and use sophisticated algorithms to predict our actions. But how exactly do they decide which of our thoughts are threatening, and which ones are harmless? Which words have the potential to flag us as terrorists? The answer may surprise you.<br>
<br>
A Slovenian artist by the name of Emile Kozole has compiled a few of the words that international agencies use to identify terrorists. It’s a growing list that may include upwards of 40,000 words. He in turn used these words to create a font that crosses out everything you type that might be flagged by the NSA. He has since dubbed this, “Project Seen.” You can try out his font for yourself at projectseen.com, where you can also download it for your own personal use. You’d be shocked by some of the mundane words that can have you placed on some government watchlist.<br>
<br>
Kozole explained his reasons for creating the font. “I still wanted to show and educate people on how ‘normal’ words we use in our online conversations on Facebook, emails, or search queries on Google are all stored and could potentially get you in trouble.” Perhaps such a font will make the public realize that the freedom and security of the internet is in jeopardy at the hands of the NSA.</div></blockquote>

<div class="content">It seems incredible that there are 40,000 flagged words when the average English speaker has a vocabulary of 20,000 words. Perhaps terrorists use a very specialized dialect. In case anyone missed it, CISA just became law hidden within a mandatory spending bill - crafted by a Republican Congress and signed by a Democrat President. By now it seems that they consider us the enemy. They also consider anyone else the enemy. Which means that they have implicitly declared themselves to be the enemy of everyone. If that's the kind of leadership that we have voted into office, we might want to spend closer attention to our electoral process. I wonder how many incriminating words I used. Perhaps I should devise a font with everything crossed out. I could call it"Freedom of Speech."</div>

<div class="content">When the word search first came out, I purposely looked for a list of those"bad" words. Then I listed them all in an e-mail and sent it to everyone I knew, Facebook, and a few forums. And people I knew sent them out too. All done under the title"Freedom of Speech". A few thousand people wasting their time with NSA having to reread their own list was fun. Now to find that 40,000 word list. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span></div>

<div class="content">We used to attach junk mail business reply envelopes to bricks wrapped in grocery bag paper. Same idea, but not traceable. Seems to me you could continue to use the older list. I'm sure they didn't drop any words from the list. But I'd be careful. Annoyance might be a suspicious activity.</div>

<div class="content">“Rightwing extremism,” the lexicon defines as those “who can be broadly divided into those who are primarily hate-oriented, and those who are mainly antigovernment and reject federal authority in favor of state or local authority. This term also may refer to rightwing extremist movements that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.”<br>
