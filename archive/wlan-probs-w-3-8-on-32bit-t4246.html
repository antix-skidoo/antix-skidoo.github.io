Can you say with certainty that it is always on the 32 bit 3.8.4 kernel in which you miss seeing the Netgear ESSID? Could it be coincidence, or is your Wifi access always consistent with other kernels, yet not with the 32 bit instance of the 3.8.4 kernel?<br>
<br>
If it is really problematic with only the 3.8.4 kernel, but not the others, then the solution is clear - assuming that is the only variable: use a different kernel. Why that particular kernel would be problematic is beyond me, but there is a chance that the actual issue is not associated with the kernel specifically, but perhaps with the router or the interaction with the other Wifi access spots.<br>
<br>
At one point in time, I was consistently finding that neighboring Wifi access points were attempting to use the same Wifi channel as the one that I was using. The solution for me was to watch the channels being used, and if the other access points were always using the same ones. If they were, I just reprogrammed my wireless router to a different channel and set it to a fixed channel number and that permanently fixed the problem (unless yet another channel came along, in which case, I may have had to repeat this exercise).<br>
<br>
Based on these comments, you can see that there is the potential that the real problem could be intermittent Wifi channel access contention, and that is why I posed the question about whether a particular kernel is at fault or not. If it's ALWAYS the kernel, then we can point the finger at the kernel, but if the access points in your area vary from time to time, as they have in the areas where I've lived, then that is a more likely variable - an ever changing one at that, and that is one possible reason why you do not see consistent behavior.<br>
<br>
So, there are at least two possibilities, maybe more than that: 1. The 32 bit 3.8.4 kernel isn't as robust as it needs to be for Wifi access; if so, use a kernel that you've known to work. There are plenty of kernels available: antiX kernels of different versions, Debian kernels, and Liquorix kernels, to name three alternate sources; each have several versions available; use what works for you, that's why we keep plenty of options available in order to address various different hardware issues. 2. Diagnose and experiment with Wifi channels. I've seen a lot of channel conflict in the areas I've lived, especially with channels 6 and 7. Belkin and Netgear inexpensive routers tend to contend for those channels unless you explicitly reprogram your router to a different channel. Some ISPs, when they install their Wifi setup for you, will take care of channel contention in dense areas where they install everyone's equipment; if you handle it yourself, you can see what channels have strong signals that could interfere, and you can choose a different channel. 3. Some inexpensive routers just don't work all that well, and seem to benefit from an occasional power cycle reboot, even when you've done all of these things. Belkin and Netgear routers are generally inexpensive and usually fall into this category.<br>
<br>
Hope this is useful.</div>

Yes! This is certainly true - infact, 3.8.0 doesn't even see wlan0. I don't have 32bit 3.8.1, 2 or 3 - and they seem to have disappeared from Daveserver but, I can say with some certainty,"3.7, good - 3.8, bad". During the time I had antiX 32bit installed on the 64bit Samsung, the same was true but I haven't reinsalled it - only antiX 64 which is now good.<br>

So far as I can see, that's not a problem - although the three marked routers: NETGEAR-2.4-G, Netgear &amp; Powerbook are all essentially the same. The NETGEAR-2.4-G is a router my son got hold of when we started having trouble last year and is a 'cable' (rather than copper wire) device. Other members of the family are using it successfully. I can connect to it but never get anything out of it - but that may be because - I have just realized - it's using WPA2 &amp; I'm using WPA-PSK (I'll look at that tomorrow) The Powerbook is one of my son's machines which uses WEP.<br>

Thanks for your help. Actually, I'm not unhappy with 3.7.10 (I wasn't unhappy with 3.5.0) but, if it should work, I'd like to know if it's me who's doing something wrong.<br>
<br>
Thanks again<br>

<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Can you say with certainty that it is always on the 32 bit 3.8.4 kernel in which you miss seeing the Netgear ESSID? Could it be coincidence, or is your Wifi access always consistent with other kernels, yet not with the 32 bit instance of the 3.8.4 kernel?</div></blockquote>
Yes! This is certainly true - infact, 3.8.0 doesn't even see wlan0. I don't have 32bit 3.8.1, 2 or 3 - and they seem to have disappeared from Daveserver but, I can say with some certainty,"3.7, good - 3.8, bad". During the time I had antiX 32bit installed on the 64bit Samsung, the same was true but I haven't reinsalled it - only antiX 64 which is now good.<br>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>At one point in time, I was consistently finding that neighboring Wifi access points were attempting to use the same Wifi channel as the one that I was using. The solution for me was to watch the channels being used, and if the other access points were always using the same ones.
</div></blockquote>
So far as I can see, that's not a problem - although the three marked routers: NETGEAR-2.4-G, Netgear &amp; Powerbook are all essentially the same. The NETGEAR-2.4-G is a router my son got hold of when we started having trouble last year and is a 'cable' (rather than copper wire) device. Other members of the family are using it successfully. I can connect to it but never get anything out of it - but that may be because - I have just realized - it's using WPA2 &amp; I'm using WPA-PSK (I'll look at that tomorrow) The Powerbook is one of my son's machines which uses WEP.<br>
