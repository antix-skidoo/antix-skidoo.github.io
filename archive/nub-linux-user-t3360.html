<div class="content">I am new to, well somewhat new to Linux. I do not know the in's and out's of details about the os or anything, but I really enjoy messing around with the Linux distros. I have chosen this distro for an old computer and think that I will really like it. I'm setting it up on an older desktop that has 2 small hard drives. one is a 9 gig drive and the other is a 40 gig. I have had no problems installing it to the 9 gig, but that leaves the larger drive kinda useless. I want to know how to set up the second drive so that any software I download and install to the system will use that drive. I have tried gparted, but no luck so far. I even tried to find other programs in the package manager to make changes but that didn't work ether. I even have tried to do a custom install but could only select one drive for anything I wanted to do. I need to know if what I want to do is possible, and the easiest way to do it. I know or at least understand a little about the file structures, and about root and non root stuff although I am no expert. if someone can give me a step by step guild, it would be very helpful. thanks.</div>

<div class="content">HI repulsivefrog.<br>
<br>
Not sure if my tutorial wil fit the bill. If wanting to install AntiX into seperate / and /home partitions is what you are shooting for. 9 gig for / and rest of drive for /home. <br>
<br>
antix-11-eeepc-900-install-finished-t3104.html<br>
<br>
I hope you get a general idea from my tutorial. I have not made a tutorial for single drive laptop install as I just use the whole drive anymore for install which in your case would be <br>
49 gig for /. I found that liqourix kernel upgrades using smxi script go better/no errors with that kind of setup vs a dual partition setup. <br>

<div class="content">What you want to do is possible, and it's not very difficult.<br>
You can mount all things where you want, even after installation.<br>
Programs which get installed will end in /usr; and that often is mounted on a separate partition.<br>
But 9Gig's for root ( / ) should be (more than) sufficient.<br>
(If you plan to compile a lot of software on your own, instead of using pre-compiled binaries, you ~might~ need more, else you don't need a lot of space for /. In fact i often install on hard-disks which are less than 5Gigs.<br>
<br>
Like rokytnji said the best solution is probably to use the second hard-drive for /home<br>
You can either make a separate folder, say /home/username/data, and mount it there, or you mount all of home at the other drive.<br>
To do so you would -more or less simply- edit the file /etc/fstab.<br>
If someone shall tell you what you have to do you should post <br>
a) the content of /etc/fstab<br>
b) the output of the command"fdisk -l" ; run as root, but without quotas<br>
c) say what you want (for example: i want to mount all of home at the second drive, i still want to mount /usr there, or something like that).<br>
<br>
Using a folder called"data" in home has got a few advantages, in my humble opinion.<br>
(one being: You want to backup the whole operating system, including your user settings. All you have to do is umount /home/username/data, and you can backup the whole thing easily. Once done remount"data", and all is fine).<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Assuming </span>your second drive is /dev/sdb1, the entry in fstab would look similar to this:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>/dev/sdb1     /home/my_name/data ext3 noatime,defaults    0   2</code></pre></div>
after creating the folder called"data".<br>
run"mount -a" and test if it works. After the reboot it should be mounted automatically.<br>
Using UUID's is better than device names (like /dev/sdb1)
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>UUID=3cbc1510-070f-4c0e-80a4-a64ebb907717      /home/my_name ext3 noatime,defaults    0   2</code></pre></div>
and the command"blkid" will tell you which is the UUID you are looking for. <br>
<br>
I did not look at the how-to of rokytnji, and it might be more clear than what i just wrote.<br>
If in doubt post the output of"fdisk -l" and the content of /etc/fstab (like said)<br>
As long you don't run out of space there doesn't seem to be much pressure to do anything at all. <span class="emoticon"> __{{emoticon}}__ </span> <br>

good luck</div>
