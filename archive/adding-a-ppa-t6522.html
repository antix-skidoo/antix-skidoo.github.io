<div class="content">I am using antiX-15.1 on one of my computers and antiX-16 on another. Both have 32-bit processors.<br>
<br>
I have manually added the BleachBit 1.12 program as well as the VeraCrypt 1.17 program to them.<br>
<br>
However I would also like to add a PPA so that these programs will update automatically (using the regular daily apt-get commands).<br>
<br>
In addition I would like to install the HandBrake program and this one requires a PPA for installation as well as for the daily upgrades.<br>
<br>
Is there anyone here who has installed a PPA for any of these programs? I am reluctant to install a"Ubuntu" PPA(s) unless I were to know that it/they would work properly.<br>
<br>
There are some other PPAs I would also like to install - VLC nightly build and the WebUpd8 one for Audacious, etc., but these are not as important to me as the first three I mentioned.<br>
<br>
I would also appreciate information as to how exactly to install a PPA into antiX if the process is different than that for Ubuntu (my only experience with installing PPAs is with Ubuntu and its variants).<br>
<br>
I hope that what I wish to do is feasible and I want to thank in advance anyone who can help me.</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the general idea of adding a PPA to use with antiX, based on existing Ubuntu PPA.<br>
<br>
I've experimented with software from other distributions, tacking or adding it into a different distribution. Often it works, but sometimes it can be quirky, and unexpected, unexplained problems can emerge. Occasionally it won't work at all.<br>
<br>
I'd say that if you are astute enough to do it and also well-versed enough to backup your system and also know how to back out or remove things that don't work, it may be"worth the risk" for you to fool around with it. Understand that you may be operating in mostly"uncharted waters", so if something doesn't work, breaks something else, or simply has odd side effects, we may not have much ability to help you out, other than to guide how to remove (or reinstall) the work.<br>
<br>
If those things are not too disturbing to you, it may be"fun" to cruise around"in the unknown". Ubuntu software is mostly based on Debian software. Sometimes it's pretty close to what is distributed in antiX, which also is derived from Debian software. Hopefully there are no components that will pull in conflicting packages and/or systemd - that is one of the greatest risks that could result from this kind of experimentation.<br>
<br>
To be honest with you, most of the time when I want software that is not directly available from Debian sources, what I do in that case is download the software archive (usually a tar.gz or .tgz file), unarchive or uncompress it into a folder beneath my home directory, and in that way I can have multiple copies, in different directories, of software that may not be"standard" - such as an Alpha or Beta test component, experiment with it, update it, then modify or replace it without affecting anything else.<br>
<br>
That also requires some experience, but it's no more complicated than it is to add or remove PPA configurations (at least for someone with moderate to strong experience).</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to everyone for this information. I am going to try some, perhaps all, of the solutions. I have nothing to lose. Should something"break," why it's easy to just reinstall the entire system.<br>
<br>
Thanks again!</div>
