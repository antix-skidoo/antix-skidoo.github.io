<div class="content">...this computer appeared. It's a Compaq case, an HP motherboard, a PII cpu with 256 mb RAM (maxed out), mis-matched optical drives (white and silver) and a black floppy drive. It's, also, running a 6 gb hdd with a 425 mb hdd dedicated to SWAP. Actually, a victory of spare parts over common sense; but, it runs really well. I knew it wouldn't run any of the larger distros I have like MEPIS 6.5 and 7.0, so I burned off a copy of Antix 7.0 and the rest, as they say, is history.<br>
It's faster than I expected on this machine and runs great as stated earlier. I just have to learn my way around the OS.<br>
As for me, I've been a member of the MEPIS forums for a while living over here in Augusta, WV. I've been knocking around the linux world for about 3.5 years mostly larger distros using Gnome or KDE. This is my first attempt at a"small" distro using Fluxbox. I'm impressed. I'm a computer hobbyist. My job doesn't require me to run a computer; I just like to tinker.</div>

Nice job putting all of those parts together. Glad it all worked nicely with AntiX driving it!</div>
